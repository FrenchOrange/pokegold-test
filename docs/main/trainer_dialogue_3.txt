\xf000븉\x0001\x0001First, I must tell you…<LINE>I am the king of TEAM PLASMA.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001GHETSIS asked me to work with him to save<LINE>the POKéMON.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001I wonder how many POKéMON<LINE>exist in this world…\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
Wow… As I thought, it's high…<LINE>Ah… I may be getting scared…
Ugh… It's swaying… Isn't it? It is!<LINE>I'm scared of how high up we are…
Ahh… No, no… This is my limit.<LINE>Here… Sit a little closer, OK?
It's getting higher and higher…<LINE>Ulp. This is going faster than I thought.
Oh! Come look here!<LINE>Look! Ulp, I'm not feeling so good…
… … … … … …<LINE>… … … … … …
I thought I'd enjoy this ride, but I feel<LINE>like I'm enclosed in a tiny little space…
Luckily, I'm not scared of heights.<LINE>That would not be cool for a Hiker.
I'm gonna stay cool. Feel cool on the<LINE>inside, look cool on the outside.
Uh-oh. It's higher than I thought.<LINE>Ulp. It's swaying more than I expected.
Oh! Don't move! We'll fall!<LINE>Do…not…move…
Eep… I can't take it. This is my limit.<LINE>W-w-will you hold my hand?
It's a great view… G-great…<LINE>B-b-but…
I'm not crying. I'm not…<LINE>Sorry… Can I sit next to you?
Just…just until we start to descend…<LINE>Please…stay…
Um-hmm…<LINE>Since we have time, shall we talk?
Um-hm… That's right… No way!<LINE>Then… Um-hmm… Yes, yes… Um-hm…

Yay! Yaaaay! It's going round and round!<LINE>Yaaay! Yaaaay! It's going up and up!
Yaaaay! So high up! Up in the sky!<LINE>Hee hee. It's fun!
Look how far we can see!<LINE>Look! Please, Trainer?
The city is getting smaller and smaller…<LINE>Such a pretty sight…
Krrf! Krrrf! Krrrf!<LINE>Sorry… It's a bit chilly for me…
I think it's finally warming up. I'm<LINE>feeling better. Thanks for the company.
