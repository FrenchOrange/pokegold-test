I'm making a delicious soup with<LINE>well-stewed vegetables.
Since her yammering stops while she's<LINE>cooking, it's another bonus for me.
Even a young 'un like yourself will catch<LINE>cold if you get soaked by that cold rain.<LINE>Sit right down and have some soup,<LINE>why don't you?
That's nice. A young 'un like you<LINE>shouldn't be shy.
Come now, just have a little.<LINE>It's good for you.<LINE>Would you listen to an old lady's story<LINE>for a moment?
In the Unova region, you see, there is a<LINE>POKéMON called Thundurus<LINE><LINE>that creates thunderstorms.<LINE>It flies around the region and sets loose<LINE>wild winds and crashing lightning.
In the Unova region, you see, there is a<LINE>POKéMON called Tornadus that<LINE><LINE>causes windstorms.<LINE>It flies around the region while letting<LINE>loose wild winds and pounding rain.
Have some soup now, dear.<LINE>It'll warm you up.
A soup jam-packed with healthy<LINE>vegetables. It's delicious!
The heavy rain is ruining the crops<LINE>I've worked so hard to raise!<LINE>What a troublesome POKéMON!
I thought I would try to catch it, but it<LINE>flies around so fast that even when I<LINE><LINE>thought I'd found it, it just flew away.
In one day, it can make a lap around the<LINE>entire Unova region.<LINE>In the mornings, it's in the south,<LINE>and in the evenings, it's in the north.<LINE>It shows up here in the evenings!
It seems like someone somewhere<LINE>taught that stormy POKéMON a lesson.<LINE>I wonder if it was…?
Long ago, I was a sharp-lookin' young<LINE>man, and my wife was a fiiine-lookin' girl.<LINE><LINE>This is a story from way back then.<LINE>Right around here, a certain POKéMON<LINE>taught a lesson to Thundurus, who had<LINE><LINE>been causin' trouble dropping lightning.<LINE>For around 30 years after that,<LINE>Thundurus kept calm, and it hid<LINE><LINE>somewhere around here.

If you go in the tall grass during<LINE>a storm, it might pop out.
There is a POKéMON that<LINE>quieted Thundurus.<LINE>I remember hearing that there is a<LINE>shrine built to honor that POKéMON<LINE><LINE>somewhere on Route 14.

Oh my. Your POKéMON team…<LINE>It seems all worn out.<LINE>Rest for just a moment now!
Walking on the raised walkways<LINE>is more tiring than you think, right?
Granny's meals are always<LINE>nothing but vegetables!
Know the electric bulletin boards?<LINE>They'll tell you when lightning is<LINE>crashing down somewhere!
