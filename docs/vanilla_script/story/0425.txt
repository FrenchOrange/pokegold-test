Iris: Guess what!!<LINE>I can teach you the strongest<LINE>Dragon-type move!<LINE>Fun, huh? Want me to<LINE>teach your Pokémon this move?
OK! Well, if you change your mind,<LINE>come again, OK?
Let me see...<LINE>Well, this Pokémon can learn the move,<LINE>but you need to have a really strong<LINE><LINE>bond of friendship first.<LINE>I don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great!<LINE>Oh, but...<LINE>You don't seem to have a<LINE>Pokémon that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which Pokémon should<LINE>learn this move?
Um... I'm sorry...<LINE>That Pokémon can't learn this move!
What?<LINE>You want me to teach the move to an Egg?<LINE>OK, I'll do my best!<LINE>...<LINE>...<LINE>Sorry!<LINE>I think it's impossible!
This one?<LINE>Um, but...it looks like this Pokémon<LINE>already knows \xf000ć\x0001\x0000.
Iris: Draco Meteor's power is<LINE>really amazing!<LINE>But after you use it, your Sp. Atk stat<LINE>goes down.

\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 learned<LINE>\xf000ć\x0001\x0001!
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 is trying to<LINE>learn \xf000ć\x0001\x0001!<LINE>But \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 can't learn more than<LINE>four moves.<LINE>Delete a move to make room<LINE>for \xf000ć\x0001\x0001?
Give up on learning the<LINE>move \xf000ć\x0001\x0000?
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 did not learn \xf000ć\x0001\x0001!
Is it OK to forget the<LINE>move \xf000ć\x0001\x0000?
1, \xf000븂\x0001\x00142, and\xf000븂\x0001\x0014... \xf000븂\x0001\x0014... \xf000븂\x0001\x0014... Ta-da!\xf000븅\x0001\x0003\xf000븅\x0001\x0006<LINE>\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 forgot how to<LINE>use \xf000ć\x0001\x0001.<LINE>And...
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 learned \xf000ć\x0001\x0002!
Drayden: If you wish, I can teach your<LINE>Pokémon the strongest<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type move.<LINE>Would you like your Pokémon to learn<LINE>that move?
Understood.<LINE>Come again if you change your mind.
Hmm...<LINE>This Pokémon can learn this move, but<LINE>your bond of friendship is not yet<LINE><LINE>strong enough.<LINE>That means I cannot teach<LINE>it this move.
I see...<LINE>But there are no Pokémon with<LINE>you right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should<LINE>learn this move?
I'm very sorry, but...<LINE>This Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but...<LINE>Not even I can teach a move to an Egg.
Hmm... It looks like this Pokémon<LINE>already knows \xf000ć\x0001\x0000.
Drayden: Draco Meteor's power is<LINE>exceptional, but using it lowers<LINE><LINE>the user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought<LINE>you here...<LINE>Very well.<LINE>Let me reward your passion with some<LINE>absolutely astounding moves.<LINE>They're the ultimate moves!<LINE>Shall I teach them to<LINE>your Pokémon?

The Pokémon with you can't<LINE>learn these moves!<LINE>Go talk to my wife! Keh!!
Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well.<LINE>Visit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which Pokémon should I teach?
That Pokémon can't learn a move!<LINE>Go talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg?<LINE>Impossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your Pokémon<LINE>is not strong enough! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows<LINE>that move! Keh!
I should teach \xf000ć\x0001\x0001 to<LINE><PLAYER>, right? Keh!

Heya!<LINE>The professor gave you a Pokémon to<LINE>start your journey, right?<LINE>If that Pokémon is still with you, and if<LINE>you two have a strong bond, there's a<LINE><LINE>special move it can learn...<LINE>Want me to teach it a battle combo move?
A special move...<LINE>Should I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so...<LINE>Well, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this<LINE>special move!<LINE>I told ya, it's only for the Pokémon who<LINE>started your journey with you.
Teach a move to an Egg?<LINE>What kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look<LINE>like it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon<LINE>already knows the special move!
Want me to teach \xf000ć\x0001\x0001<LINE>to <PLAYER>?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are<LINE>the ones you get from the professor!<LINE>To teach all of these Pokémon a<LINE>special move, a battle combo move...<LINE><LINE>That's my pledge!
