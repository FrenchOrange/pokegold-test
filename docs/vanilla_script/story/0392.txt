Halt! The key to open this gate<LINE>is the Quake Badge!

Oh, holder of the Quake Badge!<LINE>Make your foes' hearts tremble!
First, obtain the Quake Badge<LINE>from the Driftveil Pok√©mon Gym!

Gates are placed at the border of one<LINE>space and another space.<LINE>In other words, gates mean that the<LINE>world beyond here is a different world.<LINE>It does feel like every time you pass<LINE>through a gate, you're going to a<LINE><LINE>different world.<LINE>And you remember the Gym Leader who<LINE>gave you the Badge at the same time...<LINE>But without the Quake Badge,<LINE>you cannot proceed.
