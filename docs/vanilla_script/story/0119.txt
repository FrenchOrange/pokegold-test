You appear ready to face a Gym Leader.<LINE>Then...<LINE>Bring it!
In honor of your stout heart,<LINE>I will give you this.
<PLAYER> received<LINE>the Freeze Badge from Brycen!
You have seven Badges.<LINE>That means Pokémon up to Lv. 80<LINE>will obey you.<LINE>This TM will convey my regard<LINE>for your accomplishments.
A move that always results in<LINE>a critical hit: Frost Breath.
No matter how many battles I fight,<LINE>I don't know what strength is.<LINE>Perhaps you can find the answer.
Only those who are weak need to<LINE>flaunt their strength.
Brycen: In the past, when I was hurt and<LINE>depressed, Alder shared this with me...<LINE>There is strength in being with other<LINE>people and Pokémon. Receiving their<LINE><LINE>support makes you stronger.<LINE>The young man named Cheren<LINE>also seems to understand this now.
Please take this Fresh Water!
Ice can be melted with Fire<LINE>or shattered with Fighting.<LINE>Or you might want to smash it<LINE>into dust with Rock or Steel.
From Brycen, I've learned how to<LINE>say more with fewer words.
