Hey! Trainer!<LINE>There is a bit of a problem up ahead.<LINE>Sorry, but you can't pass now.<LINE>You should go kill some time by<LINE>challenging the CASTELIA CITY GYM!
Deep in the desert ahead of here,<LINE>at the DESERT RESORT,<LINE><LINE>there are some ruins that have<LINE><LINE>become a little tourist destination!
CHEREN: I believe it would be wise for me<LINE>to catch some Ground-type POKéMON.<LINE>Or perhaps I should strengthen my<LINE>POKéMON. What's my best path forward?
CHEREN: Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I've been waiting for you to get<LINE>the Insect BADGE.<LINE>And now it's time to see which one of us<LINE>is the stronger Trainer!
CHEREN: It's now clear to me.<LINE>The reason you are so tough is the trust<LINE>between you and your POKéMON.<LINE>But…that shouldn't be a problem.<LINE>I can get more out of <PLAYER><LINE>and my other POKéMON, too.
The XCASTER is ringing.
<PLAYER> picked up the XCASTER.
CHEREN: NIMBASA CITY's gate is<LINE>straight down ROUTE 4.
When I look at the freeway,<LINE>I feel exhilarated!
Ruins buried in the desert…<LINE>It's like a grand adventure in a story.
Oh! Trainer, take a look at the sand.<LINE>Do you see how some areas are lighter?<LINE>And some of the sand looks…darker…<LINE>POKéMON are hiding in the darker sand!
ROUTE 4

Trainer Tips!<LINE><LINE>POKéMON have a source of energy<LINE>for using moves.<LINE>It's called PP, meaning Power Points.<LINE>They have PP for each move.<LINE>When a move has no PP remaining,<LINE>that POKéMON cannot use that move.<LINE>That's a good time to head for<LINE>the POKéMON CENTER!
Tired Workers should head<LINE>to the prefab house by CASTELIA CITY!
