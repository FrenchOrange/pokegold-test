I'm the Day-Care Man.<LINE>We take care of the precious Pokémon<LINE>of other Trainers.<LINE>If you'd like us to raise your<LINE>Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Glad you came!<LINE>Your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000's doing just fine.
Glad you came!<LINE>Your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 and<LINE>\xf000Ă\x0001\x0001 are doing just fine.<LINE>The two seem to get along very well!

Glad you came!<LINE>Your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 and<LINE>\xf000Ă\x0001\x0001 are doing just fine.<LINE>The two don't really seem to like<LINE>each other much.
Glad you came!<LINE>Your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 and<LINE>\xf000Ă\x0001\x0001 are doing just fine.<LINE>The two prefer to play with other<LINE>Pokémon more than with each other.
Ah, it's you!<LINE>We were raising your Pokémon,<LINE>and my goodness, were we surprised!<LINE>Your Pokémon was holding an Egg!<LINE>We don't know how it got there,<LINE>but your Pokémon had it.<LINE>You do want it, don't you?
<PLAYER> received the Egg from<LINE>the Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
You have no room for it right now...<LINE>Come back when you've made room.
I really will keep it.<LINE>You do want this Egg, yes?
Well then, I'll hang on to it.<LINE>Thanks!
I'm the Day-Care Lady.<LINE>We can raise Pokémon for you.<LINE>Would you like us to raise<LINE>your Pokémon?
I'm the Day-Care Lady.<LINE>We can raise Pokémon for you.<LINE>What do you want to do today?
Very good.<LINE>Come again.
Ah, there you are!<LINE>My husband was looking for you.
You can't leave your only Pokémon<LINE>with me! How would you battle?<LINE>Come back another time.
Which Pokémon should we raise<LINE>for you?
Now, now.<LINE>That is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000<LINE>for a while.
Come back for it later.
We can raise two of your Pokémon.<LINE>Would you like us to raise another?
You have energetic Pokémon.<LINE>Do you want your Pokémon back?
By level, your <PLAYER> has<LINE>grown by about \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001.
If you want your <PLAYER> back,<LINE>it will cost $\xf000Ȅ\x0001\x0001.<LINE><LINE>Do you want it back?
You don't have enough money...
<POKEMON> took <PLAYER> back<LINE>from the Day-Care Lady.
Do you want to take back the other<LINE>one, too? 
Huh? Now, now.<LINE>If you leave that Pokémon with<LINE>me, you'll be left with just one.<LINE>You will be better off if you catch<LINE>some more, if I do say so myself.
