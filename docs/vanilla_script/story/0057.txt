The number of Trainers on the<LINE>Royal Unova today is \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0003.<LINE>The ship is nearing the port.<LINE>Would you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship!<LINE>I would like to give you advice 'cause<LINE><LINE>you need help finding Trainers!<LINE>Do you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long<LINE>stories, and they just keep talking<LINE><LINE>until they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation<LINE>deck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with<LINE>blue doors for someone to battle,<LINE><LINE>you’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the<LINE>cabins with blue doors today is \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0002.
It's running on the ocean!<LINE>What a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to<LINE>the observation deck or battle some<LINE><LINE>Trainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves,<LINE>but it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing<LINE>the scenery from the deck...<LINE><LINE>This ship is the best!
I'm still wondering which cabin to enter.
I came here from Johto for business,<LINE>but everything is dynamic here.
Are you from Unova?<LINE>I came here from Johto for business.<LINE>As I thought, a foreign region is<LINE>so different! What's the difference?<LINE>... ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... ... so,<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>Well, ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ... Don't you agree?
Oh! A whistle is blowing!<LINE>Sorry to keep you so long...<LINE>But it was fun to talk with you.<LINE>Thank you!
A battle break from work!<LINE>It is particularly fun.
I had a great battle on my break<LINE>from work.
There are yet more Pokémon across<LINE>the water!<LINE>The excitement never stops!
I am having a relaxing time in this<LINE>opulent cabin.
I heard that strong Trainers gather<LINE>here, so I came all the way from Sinnoh!<LINE>Let me enjoy some Pokémon battles!
I can have Pokémon battles while<LINE>I'm being rocked in the ship.<LINE>Plus, I can see Pokémon that are rarely<LINE>seen. I am soooo happy!
I heard a lot of Trainers in this ship<LINE>are from the other side of the ocean.<LINE>Speaking of which, I am also from Kanto!
Did you go to the observation deck?<LINE>You can see an incredible view!
Having Pokémon battles while on the ship,<LINE>being rocked by the ocean waves...<LINE><LINE>Isn't it exciting?
I lost...<LINE>Maybe I will go check out the view...
Cool! Cool!<LINE>What is cool?<LINE>This ship! This ship!<LINE>...Which part is cool?<LINE>Hmmmm... It's just cool!
A Pokémon battle!<LINE>I thought about it, but...<LINE>I don't have any Pokémon with me!
OK, Trainer! I will give you a practical<LINE>demonstration that I am not just some<LINE><LINE>kid who wears shorts!
Argh! I lost!<LINE>I take off my socks to you!
Listen! Listen!<LINE>I love this ship 'cause I can<LINE><LINE>bring my Pokémon on board!
Hey! Will you listen to my story?<LINE>The other day, I went to Nimbasa City!<LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... ... I know, right?<LINE><LINE>Then, ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... That's what I heard, anyway!
Oh! A whistle!<LINE>I apologize for making you listen<LINE>to my long story...<LINE><LINE>But it was fun talking to you. Thanks!
I am a Trainer.<LINE>I came from a faraway region.<LINE><LINE>I will show you my rarely seen Pokémon!
My Pokémon! Weren't they unusual?<LINE>In particular, Wormadam is my favorite!
This gorgeous ship suits a rich person<LINE>like me très bien. Am I right?
They blow a whistle five times!<LINE>Even if I pretend I don't hear it,<LINE><LINE>when they blow five times, it's the end...
I will show you a graceful battle<LINE>on this elegant ship!
Even if I lose the battle, I will not lose<LINE>my grace.<LINE><LINE>That's how a Rich Boy behaves.
Oh, their room service?<LINE>I tried the specialty, Royal Unova tea.<LINE>It tasted wonderful!
The beautiful scenery outside the window<LINE>is perfection, but I also like the royal<LINE><LINE>atmosphere inside the cabin.
With a few waltz steps, I will<LINE>choreograph a royal Pokémon battle!
I am enraptured with the royal<LINE>Pokémon battle...
From your standpoint,<LINE>I am a Trainer from beyond the sea,<LINE><LINE>and from my standpoint,<LINE><LINE>you are a Trainer from beyond the sea!
Oh, what a cute guest!<LINE>Would you like a cup of tea?<LINE><LINE>Come! Sit there and listen to my story!<LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... but<LINE><LINE>it ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ..., you see!
Sorry, sorry.<LINE>I talked too much.<LINE><LINE>It was fun, though. Thank you!
Heh heh. A Pokémon battle?<LINE>I got tired of relaxing in my cabin.<LINE>Well, let's dance, Trainer!
You see two or three moves ahead.<LINE>Sure enough, I can't win against youth!
Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers?<LINE>Sorry, I don't know where to find them.<LINE>But the crew may know where they are.
Oh, look at you!<LINE>What a cute guest!<LINE>I could talk to you for ages.<LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... exactly.<LINE><LINE>Then, ... ... ... ... <LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... That's how it is!
Oh, my! The sound of a whistle!<LINE>I am so sorry.<LINE><LINE>I rambled on too much!
Hi there! You are such a cute guest.<LINE>May I have a Pokémon battle with you?
You're not only cute--you're also<LINE>strong in Pokémon battles!
Oh, I can feel the sound in my stomach!<LINE>The sound of that whistle is powerful!
You! Did you talk to me?<LINE>You came at the right time!<LINE>I have a very funny story.<LINE>I wanted to tell the story to someone.<LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... ... That's the thing!<LINE>Then, ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... ... ...<LINE><LINE>... ... ... That's how it ends.
Oops. Did I talk your ear off? Sorry,<LINE>sorry. But I had a great time. Thanks!
To look for someone stronger than me,<LINE>I crossed over the mountains,<LINE><LINE>crossed over the sea, and came here.<LINE>My Pokémon are special because<LINE>they went through a lot of difficulties.<LINE>Now, let's have a fair battle!
I can't believe you're stronger than me.<LINE>I have traveled around the world!<LINE>Now I understand...<LINE>the world is ridiculously big!
