I am in charge of development!<LINE>I'm going to give you this, because you<LINE>came here for a company tour!
If a Pokémon holds a Scope Lens, it has<LINE>a better chance to make a critical hit!
Oh! A company tour?<LINE>Or some Pokémon practice?<LINE>Either way, I'm glad you came.<LINE>I'm happy, so I'll give you these!
I'm very happy, so I will give you<LINE>another present!
A Quick Ball makes it easier to catch a<LINE>Pokémon if you use it at the very<LINE><LINE>beginning of a battle.<LINE>And a Timer Ball makes it easier to catch<LINE>a Pokémon you've been battling<LINE><LINE>for a long time!
