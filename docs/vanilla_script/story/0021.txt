Cheren: Come with me a sec.
If you go straight from here,<LINE>there's a Pokémon Center.<LINE>And...<LINE>Use these if you want.
Cheren: Give your Pokémon a<LINE>Chesto Berry to hold. Then, if it ever<LINE><LINE>falls asleep, it will wake up immediately.<LINE>Oh, and another piece of advice--<LINE>Nacrene City's Gym Leader uses<LINE>Normal types.<LINE>If you have a Fighting-type Pokémon,<LINE>it might give you a big advantage.
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001I...want to see things no one can see.<LINE>The ideals of Pokémon inside Poké Balls.<LINE>The truths of how Trainers should be.<LINE>And a future where Pokémon<LINE>have become perfect...<LINE>Do you feel the same?\xf000븉\x0001\x0000

N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001That so?<LINE>I think my friends and I should test you<LINE>to see if you can see this future, too.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001Huh. I expected more from you.<LINE>Now pay attention.<LINE>My friends and I will test you<LINE>to see if you can see this future, too.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001Right now, my friends aren't strong<LINE>enough to save all Pokémon.<LINE>Maybe I can't solve the equation<LINE>that will change the world.<LINE>So, I need power... Power enough<LINE>to make anyone agree with me.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000

Now I know what power I need.<LINE>Reshiram!<LINE>The legendary Pokémon that, along with<LINE>the hero, created the Unova region.<LINE>It's my turn to become that hero--<LINE>and you and I will be friends!

???: Good day, Lenora.<LINE>Find any good Fossils lately?
Lenora: This is a surprise visit! Are you<LINE>suffering from artist's block again?
<PLAYER>!<LINE>This is Burgh.<LINE>He may not look like it, but he's<LINE><LINE>Castelia City's Gym Leader!
Burgh: ...Eh?<LINE>Just looking for a change of pace.<LINE>Seems hectic or something around here.<LINE>What's up?
Lenora: What's up?!<LINE>Someone just walked away with an exhibit,<LINE>that's what's up!
Bianca: Oh, hi, <PLAYER>!<LINE>What's everybody doing here?
Cheren: <PLAYER>, is there<LINE>some kind of problem?
Lenora: And these two are...?<LINE>Your friends?<LINE>...<LINE>...<LINE>Bianca and Cheren...<LINE>Oh, I see. They're Trainers.<LINE>OK, then. Let's split up and search.<LINE>I'll head this way.
Everyone!<LINE>Cheren and Bianca,<LINE>I want you to stay here at the museum.
Burgh and <PLAYER>,<LINE>you two search Pinwheel Forest!<LINE>Got it?<LINE>Burgh, you show the way!<LINE>I'm counting on you, everyone!
Burgh: Uh-huh.<LINE>You are...<PLAYER>, is it?<LINE>Are you raring to round up<LINE>our robbers?
Burgh: Uh-huh.<LINE>You are...<PLAYER>, is it?<LINE>Are you raring to round up<LINE>our robbers?
Bianca: Oh! Oh, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Take this with you!<LINE>Fennel gave me this Dowsing Machine<LINE>to give you.
Now, what did she tell me? Um...<LINE>You can use the Dowsing Machine<LINE>to find places where items are hidden.<LINE><LINE>So you can find stuff you can't even see!
Cheren: For now, all we need to do is<LINE>protect the museum, right?
Bianca: Hey, wait for me!
Lenora: It doesn't look like there are<LINE>any members of Team Plasma over here...<LINE><LINE>I think I'd better stay here, though.<LINE>Please head to Pinwheel Forest<LINE>and search very carefully!
These old textile factories<LINE>and storehouses were abandoned.<LINE>But enterprising young people<LINE>started using them as studios.<LINE>That could be called the beginning of<LINE>Nacrene City, the city of art.
That warehouse...<LINE>They're selling something good inside.
Even though it's just an old warehouse,<LINE>it's become so popular...<LINE>It makes me take a second look at<LINE>what I think things are worth.
Nacrene City is a highly fashionable<LINE>and admired locale!<LINE>Contrariwise, if you happen to be a bit<LINE>ordinary, here that's cool in its own way.
How do you like the sound of accordions?

Nacrene City Pokémon Gym<LINE>Leader: Lenora<LINE><LINE>An Archeologist with Backbone
Professor Juniper: Alder told me what's<LINE>going on.<LINE><PLAYER>, you got caught up<LINE>in something serious, it seems...
Lenora: Is this it?
Bianca: Whoa. Isn't that the...stone...<LINE>found in the Desert Resort?
Lenora: Yes, that's right, but is this<LINE>really a Dragon-type Pokémon?
Cedric: Surely...<LINE>When I investigated Dragonspiral Tower,<LINE><LINE>I found elements that were dated to the<LINE><LINE>same era as this Dark Stone!
Cedric: Surely...<LINE>When I investigated Dragonspiral Tower,<LINE><LINE>I found elements that were dated to the<LINE><LINE>same era as this Light Stone!
Professor Juniper: ...I looked into that.
Lenora: Impressive, as always.
Bianca: But, you know, we're lucky...<LINE>'Cause what if Team Plasma, like, noticed<LINE><LINE>that old stone that time...
Lenora: That's a good point.<LINE>It's clear to me that they were<LINE>trying to steal the Dragon Skull so<LINE><LINE>they could revive the legendary<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon.
If you would, <PLAYER>, take this...
Alder: Wait a moment, <PLAYER>!
If you take this Dark Stone, that<LINE>means you'll be the one to battle N<LINE><LINE>if anything happens to me.<LINE>Are you really OK with that?
If you take this Light Stone, that<LINE>means you'll be the one to battle N<LINE><LINE>if anything happens to me.<LINE>Are you really OK with that?
Alder: I understand. You are determined<LINE>to take on this duty.<LINE>Then, here it is.<LINE>Prepare yourself. Be strong.
Alder: So, you're just going to allow<LINE>N to fulfill his plans for a new world?<LINE>A world where Pokémon and Trainers<LINE>are separated?
Alder: Still, I must ask you...<LINE>Sincerely, I must ask you...<LINE>Take this stone.<LINE>Just in case it's needed!
Alder: I am deeply sorry.<LINE>I wish I didn't have to burden you.<LINE>This world of ours, where Pokémon<LINE>and people live together...<LINE>Please...<LINE>If anything happens to me, protect it!
Lenora: ...I see.<LINE>If things don't go as planned,<LINE>you'll use this Dark Stone.<LINE>You'll protect the ideal future<LINE>for us and Pokémon.<LINE><PLAYER>, we're counting on you.<LINE>Please take care of yourself.
Lenora: ...I see.<LINE>If things don't go as planned,<LINE>you'll use this Light Stone.<LINE>You'll protect the true future<LINE>for us and Pokémon.<LINE><PLAYER>, we're counting on you.<LINE>Please take care of yourself.
Cedric: ...<LINE>So, how do we wake the Dragon-type<LINE>Pokémon from the stone, then?
Huh?
...
Umm...
Lenora: That's it!<LINE>We've got them, don't we?
Alder: Ah-hah. We've got those two.
<PLAYER>!<LINE>Go to Opelucid City.<LINE>The Gym Leader of that city<LINE>uses Dragon-type Pokémon.<LINE>The Gym Leader could know something.<LINE>I'll go ahead and wait for you there!<LINE>Until then!
Professor Juniper: That's right!<LINE>Opelucid City's Iris might know something!
Professor Juniper: That's right!<LINE>Opelucid City's Drayden might<LINE>know something!
Cedric: Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Never forget that you always<LINE>have Pokémon right by your side.
Professor Juniper: I'm going to head<LINE>back to the lab and do some research...<LINE>I'll see if I can uncover what kinds of<LINE>beings these legendary Dragon-type<LINE><LINE>Pokémon are and if there is any way<LINE><LINE>to awaken them...
Lenora: Don't worry!<LINE>If we have something for you,<LINE>we'll come running to find you!
Lenora: Don't worry!<LINE>If we have something for you,<LINE>we'll come running to find you!
Bianca: Ooh. Sounds real serious...<LINE>Um, that's about all I got out of it.<LINE><PLAYER>, do you know Opelucid City?<LINE>When you leave from Icirrus City<LINE>and, like, cross the Tubeline Bridge,<LINE><LINE>it's on the other side. Umm...<LINE>I'm not that great with directions, so if<LINE>you need more, check your Town Map, OK?
