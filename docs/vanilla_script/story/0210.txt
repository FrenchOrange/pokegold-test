Team Plasma: Huh. Pretty strong...<LINE>But you're only strong because you<LINE>Trainers are controlling Pokémon!
Cheren: So if you want to set<LINE>Pokémon free...<LINE>If that's what you want, you should<LINE>start with your own.<LINE>But taking people's Pokémon by force<LINE>is not right.<LINE>That is not real strength!
Team Plasma: Hey, there you are!<LINE>We found that thing we were looking for.<LINE>We should head for the tower now!
Get this! Team Plasma has obtained<LINE>the power to change this world<LINE><LINE>and end people's control over Pokémon.
Team Plasma: That's right!<LINE>We must use force in order to right<LINE>the wrongs of the world.<LINE>Now, let's gather around our king.<LINE>Our lord N!
Cheren: Those guys... I don't know what<LINE>they've found, but they go the extra<LINE><LINE>mile to gain power and cause trouble.<LINE><LINE>What a bothersome bunch...
<PLAYER>... I'm going to stay here<LINE>for a while.<LINE>I want to think a little bit about what<LINE>the Champion asked me...<LINE>What do I want to do with my power<LINE>after I get strong?<LINE>And why do I want to be strong in the<LINE>first place?
