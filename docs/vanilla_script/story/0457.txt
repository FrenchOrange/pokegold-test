A beautiful tune is spreading<LINE>throughout the town...
Anville Town<LINE>Rolling Out the Steel Rails
It's a subway map of the Unova region.
Oh, are you also curious about<LINE>that train?
Unfortunately, no train has<LINE>come here today.
See the train there?
All righty!<LINE>Let me explain!
All righty!<LINE>All aboard!
Oh, that's a shame.
Hahaha!<LINE>You're right.
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train!<LINE>It runs faster than a rocket!<LINE><LINE>It runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest<LINE>train in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is<LINE>a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train!<LINE>This is a mass-produced car<LINE><LINE>from a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is<LINE>a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train!<LINE>Few cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train!<LINE>This is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train!<LINE>It is the fastest long-distance<LINE><LINE>high-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to<LINE>Anville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran<LINE>a long time ago.
This train car is a new train<LINE>to run in the future!
I can see!<LINE>I can see it!<LINE>That lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish<LINE>I could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the<LINE>Unova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train,<LINE>because they revised all the parts<LINE><LINE>to drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train,<LINE>the number of parts was reduced<LINE><LINE>so it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design!<LINE>Beauty and utility working together!<LINE>That kind of beautility is unique to<LINE>mass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future<LINE>mass-produced cars that will replace<LINE><LINE>the old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration!<LINE>Automated train-car controls!<LINE><LINE>It's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car.<LINE>Its body tilts while going around curves,<LINE><LINE>so it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy.<LINE>When it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it<LINE>has more parts, so I heard it was<LINE><LINE>difficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool!<LINE>The latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot<LINE>touch the Hyperspeed Train!<LINE>It really is hyper technology!<LINE>As you can see, we engineers are<LINE>always seriously dreaming that someday<LINE><LINE>the dream will become a reality!
Do you know Tubeline Bridge?<LINE>The train that runs on it is<LINE>this Single Train.
Newer trains have to be built<LINE>in a way that's both functional<LINE><LINE>and environmentally friendly.<LINE>Compared to the past, they've<LINE>improved significantly.
The number of parts influences the<LINE>budget and construction time.<LINE>The streamlined and beautiful design<LINE>of the Double Train is still valued today.
It uses the same train car<LINE>as a Super Single Train.<LINE>The only difference is the appearance.<LINE>It is a superb train car that will go down<LINE>in the history of the Battle Subway!
The technology born during the creation<LINE>of this train car made the Super Single<LINE><LINE>Train and Super Double Train possible!
Also, a regeneration brake system,<LINE>a car-body tilting system,<LINE><LINE>a whatchamacallit system,<LINE><LINE>a thingamabob system...<LINE>I don't remember all the details,<LINE>but it's just a big festival of all<LINE><LINE>the latest technology!
Faster! Farther!<LINE>Our engineers' spirits are infused in it!
The train car is the same model as a<LINE>Single Train.<LINE>Because it is an old train car, I hear the<LINE>maintenance is hard, but it's the one I<LINE><LINE>always ride, because I loved it as a kid!
The old train cars built with lots of small<LINE>parts have their own unique beauty and<LINE><LINE>attract a lot of fans.<LINE>Those cars no longer run in the<LINE>Battle Subway, but I hear they're still<LINE><LINE>used in a faraway region.<LINE>Ah... I'd love to be on that train!
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that<LINE>would be bad!<LINE>But it is full of the latest technologies!<LINE>It's undergoing a lot of testing.<LINE>It's called a gauge-convertible train.<LINE>It's a sweet car that can adjust its<LINE>wheels to run on any rail!
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving<LINE>the station shortly.<LINE>Would you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.
This is a quiet town!<LINE>Relax and stay for a while.
Gave the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 in exchange for<LINE>the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002!
Ah... I'm in trouble.<LINE>I was so engrossed in my trip that I ran<LINE>out of \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000.<LINE>Let me see...<LINE>Will you trade your \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000<LINE><LINE>for my \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Will you trade your \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000<LINE>for my \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Great, let's trade!
Oh, that's a shame.
Hehe! It was a delightful trade,<LINE>wasn't it?
...Uh-oh. You don't have<LINE>enough \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
...Uh-oh. You don't have enough room for<LINE>the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
I am a \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 collector!<LINE>You, over there! Let's have a<LINE>businesslike exchange.<LINE>Will you trade your \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for<LINE>my \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Will you trade your \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000<LINE>for my \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002?
Excellent. Let's do business!
Why? Do you think this is a bad deal?
Hah! It was a mutually beneficial trade!<LINE>This is a win-win relationship, right?
Hah! You don't have<LINE>any \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
Hah! You don't have enough room for<LINE>the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
With that face, I bet you have<LINE>something I want.<LINE>Will you trade your \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0001 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 for<LINE>my \xf000ȁ\x0001\x0003 \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002?

Yay!<LINE>Then, let's trade!
Oh, it seems I was mistaken...
Ooh-la-la! This luster!<LINE>I really like \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.<LINE>An experienced person like me can tell<LINE>the difference of the luster of each one!
Ooh-la-la!<LINE>You don't have enough \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000s.
Ooh-la-la! You don't have room for<LINE>the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0002.
It's so lively on weekends!<LINE>Oh, me? I came here to watch the trains.
You can trade lots of items.<LINE>It was surprisingly fun when I tried!
What delicious air!
I wanted to get a picture from<LINE>this angle!
Why do people love trains?<LINE>Maybe it's the design, the way they can<LINE>run so fast and still be so comfortable.<LINE>All the essential parts work together...<LINE>It's simple but so beautiful!
Trains are so cooooool!<LINE>My mom brought me, but now she's<LINE>taking pictures somewhere.
On weekends, a lot of people come here<LINE>to watch the trains.
They are full of people today, too.<LINE>Do you also trade items?
This is a rare weekend when there aren't<LINE>any trains.
A lot of train cars have a rest here.
If there are a lot of people,<LINE>I feel that the trains are happy!
Today all the train cars are resting!
The girl on the bridge...<LINE>She's playing a lullaby for all the<LINE>sleeping trains of this town.
