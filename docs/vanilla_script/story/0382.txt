I come shop at the Shopping Mall a lot<LINE>because I want all the TMs!
On the first floor, they sell medicines.<LINE>On the second floor, they sell TMs<LINE>and different kinds of Mail.<LINE>On the third floor, they sell items for<LINE>raising stats and battle items.<LINE>I really admire Mr. Clyde, the<LINE>POKéMON Gym guide, so I'm practicing<LINE><LINE>being a guide, too!
There are even some people in the mall<LINE>who will challenge you to battles.
The thing I buy most often is the item<LINE>that raises a POKéMON's HP, called HP Up.<LINE>There are also a lot of other items that<LINE>catch my eye.









Good Trainers never use only<LINE>brute force.<LINE>They think about many different<LINE>strategies, such as which POKéMON and<LINE><LINE>moves to use in battle, or the best time<LINE><LINE>to use an item.
Playing hide-and-seek would be fun!
Welcome to Shopping Mall Nine!<LINE>It's called Nine because it's on Route 9.<LINE>You can remember it by thinking of this:<LINE>“Done shopping? Nein!"
Have you heard? There's a cave<LINE>along Route 9.<LINE>I don't know exactly where it is or<LINE>what's in it, though.
Hey! POKéMON Trainer!<LINE>Do you know about an item called<LINE>the Thunderstone?
