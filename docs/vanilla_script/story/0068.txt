Did the fantastic speed leave you dizzy?<LINE>My beloved Pokémon will be the next one<LINE>to make your head spin!
My, oh my...<LINE>You have a sweet fighting style.<LINE>I mean, you're a great Trainer!<LINE>Excuse me, I...uh... Oh, here!<LINE><LINE>I want you to have this!
<PLAYER> received the<LINE>Bolt Badge from Elesa!
If you have four Badges, including this<LINE>Bolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50,<LINE><LINE>including traded Pokémon, will obey you.<LINE>Also, here's this move I like.<LINE>Feel free to use it, um, if you want to.
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with<LINE>a different Pokémon after attacking.<LINE>Of course, if you don't have another<LINE>Pokémon in your party, you can't switch.
You're going to Driftveil City next?<LINE>Of course. There is a Pokémon Gym there,<LINE>after all. Oh...<LINE>I bet you won't be able to get there.<LINE>You know what?<LINE>I'll fix it so you can cross.<LINE>Wait for me on Route 5.
What you'd like to do...<LINE>What your Pokémon would like to do...<LINE>Don't you think it could be amazing<LINE>if those are aligned?
Elesa: I think the real me is the one who<LINE>battles with Pokémon as a Gym Leader.<LINE>A model's job is to make someone else's<LINE>vision look like a reality.<LINE><LINE>It's interesting, but it's not easy...
Are you cool riding a roller coaster?
When you ride a roller coaster, the<LINE>speed can make you dizzy.<LINE>I'm going to make your head spin with<LINE>a Pokémon battle that's just as intense!
Your way of battling...<LINE>It's elegant! You've got style!<LINE><LINE>Even compared to Ms. Elesa!
If you press the switches, the<LINE>roller coaster's path will change.
Your Nimbasa Gym challenge is finally<LINE>nearing its finale.<LINE>But if you don't beat me,<LINE>you won't get to meet Ms. Elesa.
I'm also a Pokémon Trainer who was<LINE>toughened up by Ms. Elesa.<LINE>I'll show you power and style befitting<LINE>this Gym.
It pleases me to be the opponent of a<LINE>strong and honorable Trainer like you!
If you maintain your calm and don't get<LINE>flustered by this Gym's gimmicks,<LINE><LINE>you'll be able to defeat Ms. Elesa...<LINE><LINE>and any other Trainer, as well!
<PLAYER> pressed the switch.<LINE>The roller coaster's path<LINE>has been changed!
How about it? I can see you're surprised!<LINE>Would you ever have guessed that<LINE>this Gym is a roller coaster?<LINE>OK, let me fill you in...<LINE>And take this, too!
In this roller coaster Gym, the first<LINE>step is to get in the car.<LINE>Next comes the platform!<LINE>There, you can change<LINE><LINE>where the coaster is going!<LINE>Sometimes you continue by riding<LINE>the cars of opponents you defeat.<LINE><LINE>That's how you aim for the Gym Leader!<LINE>By the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't<LINE>do well against Ground-type moves...
Elesa uses sparkling bright<LINE>Electric-type attacks!<LINE>But the combination of you and your<LINE>Pokémon was even more impressive!<LINE>It was... It was...<LINE>an emotional roller coaster!
