Hi, Trainer! Do you know a Pokémon<LINE>called Audino?<LINE>It's a Pokémon that I sometimes find<LINE>when I'm walking.<LINE>It jumps out of rustling grass.<LINE>I can get a lot of Exp. Points.<LINE>It's kind of a friendly Pokémon, isn't it?
I heard that the Fossils in the museum<LINE>were found in Twist Mountain.<LINE>Then, a person called Clay apparently<LINE>donated them to the museum.
When you choose “HELP"<LINE>at the PC at a Pokémon Center,<LINE><LINE>you can learn many things. It's so cool!
