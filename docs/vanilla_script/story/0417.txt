You know, there are people in the world<LINE>with many different values.
Some people enjoy things you might not<LINE>think are fun...<LINE>Having a lot of different values in the<LINE>world makes it a richer place.<LINE><LINE>That's what I think, anyway.
I really enjoy traveling around the world<LINE>and talking with different people, but<LINE><LINE>the woman who lives here seems to think<LINE><LINE>living quietly by herself is important.
Growwwwf!
So this was Zoroark's home, then!
Zoroark was using its illusion to<LINE>trick people and Pokémon. It<LINE><LINE>wanted to keep people away from its lair.<LINE>I heard this place was suspicious, so I<LINE>came to have a look, but it looks like I<LINE><LINE>was tricked as well.

The suspicious woman attacked!
The Pokémon vanished deep into<LINE>the forest...
