Cheren: <PLAYER>!<LINE>I heard from Professor Juniper.<LINE>We can have a POKéMON?
…<LINE>…<LINE>What's keeping Bianca?
Bianca: Am I a little late again?<LINE>So-oooo-orry!
Cheren: Bianca…<LINE>I've known for ten years that you<LINE>have no sense of time, but…seriously…<LINE>Today's the day we can get a<LINE>POKéMON from Professor Juniper!
Bianca: I know. Sorry, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Sorry, Cheren.
Bianca: So, where are the POKéMON?<LINE>They were delivered to <PLAYER>'s<LINE>house, so <PLAYER> gets first pick.
Cheren: Naturally.
The POKéMON are waiting for us<LINE>inside that gift box.<LINE>OK, <PLAYER>, you go first and take<LINE>a peek at the gift box.<LINE>I want to meet the POKéMON right now!
Cheren: Aren't you going to check<LINE>out the gift box? Where are you going?
Cheren: Would you get a move on<LINE>and open the gift box already?<LINE>I'm sure the POKéMON are just as<LINE>excited to meet us!
Bianca: Ooh!<LINE>What kind of POKéMON could they be?
<PLAYER> opened the gift box!
I've brought three POKéMON,<LINE>one for you and one for each<LINE>of your friends. Please settle<LINE>your choices politely.<LINE>Enjoy your POKéMON!<LINE>                --Professor Juniper

Choose a POKéMON.
Is this the POKéMON you want?
Pick this one!
YES
NO
<PLAYER> chose<LINE><POKEMON>!
Bianca: OK, I'll take this POKéMON!<LINE>Cheren, that one's yours!
Cheren: Hey, how come you get to pick<LINE>out my POKéMON?<LINE>Oh, never mind. I wanted <POKEMON><LINE>from the start, anyway.
Bianca: Everyone has chosen a POKéMON!<LINE>…So that's that!<LINE>Hey, I know!<LINE>Let's have a POKéMON battle!
Cheren: Honestly, Bianca…<LINE>Even though they're still weak POKéMON,<LINE>you shouldn't have POKéMON battles<LINE><LINE>inside a house.
Bianca: Don't be a worrywart!<LINE>These little ones are weak, like you said.<LINE>We have to let them battle so they'll get<LINE>stronger. It's settled, <PLAYER>!<LINE><LINE>Get ready for a POKéMON battle!

…The box is empty.





Bianca: Wow…<LINE><PLAYER>, you're gonna be<LINE>an awesome Trainer someday, I can tell!<LINE>No doubt!
Bianca: Wha…?<LINE>I got so absorbed in having my POKéMON<LINE>use moves, I won before even realizing…
Cheren: Uh…<LINE>…<LINE>Bianca, would you take a look around?
Bianca: Wh-whoa!<LINE>What happened?!
Wow! POKéMON are amaaaaazing!!<LINE>So little, but so strong!<LINE>I'm so glad that I get to have a POKéMON!<LINE>…Oh.<LINE>Um, sorry about your room, <PLAYER>.
Cheren: You…are completely hopeless.<LINE>Here!<LINE>I'll restore your POKéMON for you.
Cheren healed Bianca's POKéMON!
<PLAYER>'s POKéMON needs<LINE>to be fixed up, too.
Cheren healed <PLAYER>'s POKéMON!
Cheren: It's amazing that you won<LINE>without your POKéMON's losing any<LINE><LINE>energy, which is called HP.<LINE>But you used some of the moves'<LINE>Power Points, or PP, though.
Bianca: Hey, Cheren!<LINE>How about you battle, too?<LINE>With all you know, I'm sure you can<LINE>battle without turning the room into<LINE><LINE>a disaster area like I did!
Cheren: I believe you're right!<LINE>It'll be no problem for me to keep<LINE>the room from getting any messier.<LINE>Besides, it's not fair if you two are the<LINE>only ones who get to have fun battling!




It's decided. You'll be my opponent…<LINE>in our first POKéMON battle!<LINE>Let's see what you can do, <POKEMON>!

Cheren: I made a strange blunder<LINE>in my first battle, but<LINE><LINE>this feeling I have…<LINE><LINE>…I'm finally a Trainer.<LINE>But first, we'd better go apologize to<LINE>your mother about this messed-up room.
Cheren: This feeling…<LINE>Finally, I'm a Trainer.<LINE>On top of that, we'd better go apologize<LINE>to your mother about this room.
Bianca: Oh!<LINE>I'd better come, too!
It's a Wii console!<LINE>It's not even scratched!
The bed's a mess!
