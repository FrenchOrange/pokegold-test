Oh, it's just a kid...
You... It couldn't be...<LINE>The fact that you are here means you<LINE>came to learn about the secret<LINE><LINE>of Genesect!
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from<LINE>a Fossil.<LINE>Then we enhanced the Pokémon with the<LINE>power of science!
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!
But, our lord N was not interested in<LINE>this Genesect that was modified by the<LINE><LINE>power of science!
“Science damages the natural beauty<LINE>of Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"
That's what he said...<LINE>So our research was halted, and this<LINE>facility was closed...
However!!<LINE>The Genesect research is all mine!<LINE>So if you want to know Genesect's<LINE>secret, you'll have to beat me in battle!
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything...<LINE>I forgot my duty as a Scientist is<LINE>to make the world happy.<LINE>So, this must be what I get for trying to<LINE>make a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...
I'm going to wash my hands of this<LINE>Genesect matter...<LINE>I don't need this anymore...<LINE>I'll give it to you.
There was another one in my<LINE>other pocket...
The item I just gave you was made<LINE>for Genesect.<LINE>When it holds an item like this, it<LINE>changes the type of the move called<LINE><LINE>Techno Blast, so it can always have<LINE><LINE>an advantage.
There sure are some very cowardly<LINE>Trainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives.<LINE>Use them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the<LINE>side of the monitor.<LINE>Read it?
My lord N apparently rejected<LINE>my research...<LINE>But my research is necessary for<LINE>Team Plasma to reach its goal...<LINE><LINE>The strongest Pokémon...<LINE>The rest of the memo is torn and<LINE>impossible to read.
