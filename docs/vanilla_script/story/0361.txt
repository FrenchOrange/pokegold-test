Cheren: <PLAYER>, stop!<LINE>You've got a Bolt Badge...<LINE>I've got a Bolt Badge...<LINE>Let's test who's stronger--you or me!<LINE>This time, I'm going to win!
Cheren: Why?<LINE>Why can't I beat you?
Elesa: Oh, you two are friends...<LINE>That's nice, how you're helping each<LINE>other get better by competing.
OK, let's go.
???: Oh!<LINE>Why, if it isn't Elesa!
???: Aren't festivals grand?<LINE>Life should be enjoyed!
Cheren: Who is this man?
Elesa: This is Alder,<LINE>the Unova region's Champion.
Cheren: Champion?!<LINE>Why would the Champion be<LINE>goofing off in a place like this?
Alder: I heard that remark.<LINE>You're quite a judgmental young person,<LINE><LINE>are you not?<LINE>My name is Alder. I'm the Unova<LINE>Pokémon League's Champion.<LINE>Pleased to make your acquaintance.<LINE>For your information, I'm not<LINE>goofing off. I'm on a voyage.<LINE><LINE>I know every corner of Unova.
Cheren: Um. I'm Cheren, from<LINE>Nuvema Town.<LINE>My goal as a Trainer is to<LINE>become the Champion.
Alder: Hm. Traveling with a goal in mind<LINE>is a commendable thing.<LINE>And what do you plan to do<LINE>after becoming the Champion?
Cheren: What else is there other than<LINE>striving to become stronger?<LINE>The strongest Trainer--<LINE>that's the Champion.
Alder: Hmm. Becoming stronger...<LINE>Becoming stronger, you say...<LINE><LINE>Is that alone enough of a goal? Hmmm.<LINE>It's not that I'm trying to say your way<LINE>of thinking is wrong...
In my travels, I've helped many people<LINE>learn to love Pokémon. I think that's<LINE><LINE>important, too.<LINE>If you play with those children,<LINE>you might gain more of an understanding.<LINE>Will you two have a Pokémon battle<LINE>with those two?
Hey, you two. Come<LINE>here for a moment.
Cheren: ...Understood.<LINE>But, before that...
Cheren fully healed <LINE><PLAYER>'s Pokémon!
Cheren: OK, let's battle.
Alder: Nicely done! You didn't win, but<LINE>that was a good battle. Your Pokémon<LINE><LINE>looked like they were having fun.
Young man, if there are people<LINE>like you who pursue strength,<LINE><LINE>there are also people who are<LINE><LINE>happy just being with Pokémon.<LINE>There are many different people<LINE>and many different answers.<LINE>When it comes to what a Champion<LINE>should be, you and I may hold differing<LINE><LINE>views, but so be it! Give it some thought.
Alder: It's tremendous that people and<LINE>Pokémon, each so different, can<LINE><LINE>acknowledge each other and be together!
Alder is so strong!<LINE>And he's nice to Pokémon!
I was scared of Pokémon, but Alder<LINE>taught me that they're nice and friendly.
Elesa: Let's roll.<LINE>The Driftveil Drawbridge is just ahead.
Cheren: The Champion is the strongest<LINE>of the strong! That's all there is to it.
Cheren: This way.
Elesa: Now to contact him...
It's me, Elesa.<LINE>Please lower the drawbridge.<LINE>I have a couple of Trainers here<LINE>who want to challenge you.<LINE>OK...<LINE>Thanks.
Now, watch this!
Elesa: I have a TV gig, so I've got to go.<LINE>The Gym Leader of the next town<LINE>may take some getting used to...<LINE><LINE>Do your best, both of you.
Cheren: What I am is a Trainer.<LINE>I prove I'm right by getting stronger<LINE>and winning in battle--<LINE><LINE>even against the Champion.
Excuse me!<LINE>Please stop right there!
The drawbridge is raised right now<LINE>so ships can pass. You can't cross.<LINE>If you make a request to Driftveil's Gym<LINE>Leader, Clay, he could... Well, I'm not<LINE><LINE>sure how you'd reach him over there...<LINE>If you talk to Nimbasa City's Gym Leader,<LINE>Elesa, she might be able to do something.

A bridge would be meaningless<LINE>if no one ever crossed it.<LINE>Bridges connect the world...<LINE>That's as solid as a symbol can get.
Hum fiercely! My battle song!<LINE>Battle fiercely! My Pokémon!
In battling you, I came to understand...<LINE>You're the best!<LINE>Here! This is for you!


If you want your Pokémon to<LINE>hold this Electric Guitar,<LINE><LINE>go to the Musical Theater!<LINE><LINE>Cooler than cool!
Cheren: Strength and strength alone<LINE>is what matters in this world.<LINE>So I believed, until I met Alder here.
But, winning in Pokémon battles<LINE>isn't all there is to life.<LINE>Once I learned that lesson, my eyes<LINE>were opened to many different things.
We all have our own brand of strength,<LINE>people and Pokémon both.<LINE>The strength to make our dreams<LINE>a reality, the strength to protect<LINE><LINE>what we hold most dear...
Why do I think this way now?<LINE>It's thanks to you, <PLAYER>...<LINE>And Bianca...<LINE>And Alder...<LINE>If only N could see this, too, someday.
I'm going to take a long, hard look<LINE>at myself on Victory Road.<LINE>I'm going to think about what I can do<LINE>and who I can become...<LINE>Visit me sometime, if you want.<LINE>We'll have a battle like old times.
The Pokémon and the performers<LINE>all have amazing moves!
I think being able to make people<LINE>smile is a super-awesome talent!<LINE>That's why Pokémon are so awesome!<LINE>Because they can make you smile!
The street performers are my favorites.<LINE>They're so charming!
