I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon,<LINE>'cause they're my favorites!<LINE>But they had no chance in a battle<LINE>against Water-type Pokémon…<LINE>Sigh… Maybe I should try to train<LINE>Pokémon of other types.
It is quite hard to train six Pokémon at<LINE>once, so I've heard some Trainers focus<LINE><LINE>on training three Pokémon at a time.
Skreee!
