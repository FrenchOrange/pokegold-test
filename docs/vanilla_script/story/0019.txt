I've trained only Fire-type POKéMON,<LINE>'cause they're my favorites!<LINE>But they had no chance in a battle<LINE>against Water-type POKéMON…<LINE>Sigh… Maybe I should try to train<LINE>POKéMON of other types.
It is quite hard to train six POKéMON at<LINE>once, so I've heard some Trainers focus<LINE><LINE>on training three POKéMON at a time.
Skreee!
