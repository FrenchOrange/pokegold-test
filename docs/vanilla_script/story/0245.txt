The one who obtains this Pokémon is said<LINE>to be victorious in any type<LINE><LINE>of competition...<LINE>We can obtain a power that would make<LINE>us invincible!<LINE>That is the value of this mythical<LINE>Pokémon, Victini!
This is a secret room meant<LINE>to hide Victini!<LINE>Two hundred years ago, a certain rich<LINE>person bought this entire island and hid<LINE><LINE>Victini in this underground room.<LINE>After that, no one saw Victini, and it<LINE>became a mythical Pokémon...
We, Team Plasma, will liberate Victini<LINE>from this room and use its powers to make<LINE><LINE>our goal a reality!<LINE>We won't let a brat like you get in<LINE>our way!
It looks like I underestimated<LINE>your strength.<LINE>But Victini won't be so simple!<LINE>Look!
Looks like it's waiting to test your<LINE>strength. You'd better get ready!
Living with Victini means accepting<LINE>Victini's cruel destiny...<LINE>Someday we will test you to see if you are<LINE>truly ready for that.
Victini is still close by and watching<LINE>your movements...<LINE>If you exit this room and come back, it<LINE>might return...
Ta-ta-ta-tah!
Victini vanished from the<LINE>underground room...
