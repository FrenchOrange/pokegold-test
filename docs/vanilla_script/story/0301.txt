GHETSIS: After all of that, do you think<LINE>you're still worthy of sharing the name<LINE><LINE>Harmonia with me?<LINE>You good-for-nothing boy!

<PLAYER>! I never would have<LINE>thought the legendary POKéMON<LINE><LINE>would choose a Trainer like you!<LINE><LINE>It caught me completely off guard.
This doesn't change my goal.<LINE>My plans have not been disturbed!<LINE>In order to rule this world utterly,<LINE>in order to manipulate the hearts<LINE><LINE>of people who know nothing,<LINE><LINE>I will have N be the king of TEAM PLASMA.<LINE>But, for that to work, you--<LINE>since you know the truth--<LINE><LINE>You must be eliminated!
CHEREN: Rule the world??<LINE>Wasn't TEAM PLASMA's goal to<LINE>liberate POKéMON?
GHETSIS: That was just a convenient lie<LINE>that I needed to create TEAM PLASMA.<LINE>Use your head. What's to be gained from<LINE>letting go of useful things like POKéMON?<LINE>Certainly, manipulating POKéMON<LINE>helps people expand their possibilities.<LINE><LINE>That much, I can agree with.<LINE>So it naturally follows that only I should<LINE>be able to use POKéMON!
ALDER: You fool!<LINE>That's a ridiculous idea!
GHETSIS: You can say whatever you want.<LINE>A POKéMON, even if it's revered as a<LINE>deity, is still just a POKéMON.<LINE><PLAYER>, so what if it chose you!<LINE>That doesn't mean you're a threat.<LINE>Come on!

Bzaaah…
Pweesh…
GHETSIS: What?!<LINE>I created TEAM PLASMA with my own hands.<LINE>I'm absolutely perfect! I AM PERFECTION!<LINE>I am the perfect ruler of<LINE>a perfect new world!
ALDER: Now, N…<LINE>Do you still think POKéMON<LINE>and people should be separated?
GHETSIS: Mwa ha ha!<LINE>Since I couldn't become the hero and<LINE>obtain the legendary POKéMON myself…<LINE>I prepared someone for that purpose--N!<LINE>He's nothing more than a freak<LINE>without a human heart.<LINE>Do you think you're going to get<LINE>through to a warped person like that?!
CHEREN: ALDER, it's a waste of valuable<LINE>time listening to him ramble on.<LINE>He is the one without a human heart!
ALDER: You're right.<LINE>He's truly pitiful.
N…<LINE>I'm sure you have much to think about.<LINE>I know you were not pursuing the truth<LINE>because of GHETSIS's manipulation, but<LINE><LINE>because your heart was truly inspired.<LINE>That is why you were able to meet the<LINE>legendary POKéMON!

\xf000븉\x0001\x0001I couldn't understand it.<LINE>I couldn't believe there were<LINE>POKéMON that liked people.<LINE>Because, up until that moment,<LINE>I'd never known a POKéMON like that.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001The longer my journey continued,<LINE>the more unsure I became.<LINE>All I kept meeting were POKéMON and<LINE>people who communicated with one another<LINE><LINE>and helped one another.<LINE>That was why I needed to confirm my<LINE>beliefs by battling with you.<LINE>I wanted to confront you hero-to-hero.<LINE>I needed that more than anything.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001There's no way a person like me,<LINE>someone who understands only POKéMON--<LINE>No, actually…<LINE>I didn't understand them, either.<LINE>No way could I measure up to you,<LINE>when you had met so many POKéMON<LINE><LINE>and were surrounded by friends…\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001The Champion has forgiven me, and…<LINE>What I should do now is something<LINE>I'll have to decide for myself.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
