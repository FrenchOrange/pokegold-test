Here on Route 6, there's a place called<LINE>Mistralton Cave.<LINE>Supposedly, deep in that cave you can<LINE>find an amazing POKéMON called Cobalion,<LINE><LINE>who was said to have protected POKéMON<LINE><LINE>from a sea of fire in ancient Unova.<LINE>If you can use a move called Surf<LINE>that lets you move over the water's<LINE><LINE>surface, maybe you can see Cobalion.
I've heard that there are also POKéMON<LINE>that should be called Cobalion's allies.
Now what should I do?<LINE>The entrance to Chargestone Cave,<LINE>just ahead, is blocked off.<LINE>It's because of a POKéMON called<LINE>Galvantula, and if I don't ask Clay<LINE><LINE>to do something, there's no way to pass.
Chargestone Cave seems like<LINE>a complicated maze, but actually<LINE><LINE>it's a straight road.
POKéMON with Dry Skin love Water-type<LINE>moves and rainy weather. ♪<LINE>I'm talking about the Ability<LINE>of these POKéMON, of course.
