Welcome to the Nacrene Museum!
Those robbers... What in the world is<LINE>Team Plasma?
You can get to the Pokémon Gym by going<LINE>to the back of the museum!
What do they plan to accomplish by<LINE>stealing the Dragon Skull?
Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton,<LINE>I'm...fascinated.
Welcome! I'm Hawes, the<LINE>assistant director.<LINE>Since you were kind enough to visit,<LINE>I'll give you a tour of the museum.
This skeleton is of a Dragon-type<LINE>Pokémon.<LINE>There's a theory that it had an accident<LINE>while it was flying around the world, and<LINE><LINE>so it became a Fossil.
This rock is amazing! It's a meteorite!<LINE>It contains some kind of energy<LINE>from space.
Oh, this? It's an ordinary old stone.<LINE>It was found near the desert, but other<LINE>than the fact that it's old, it doesn't<LINE><LINE>seem to have any value...<LINE>We only display it because it's rather<LINE>pretty to look at.
The Pokémon Gym is just beyond here.
At the end of the Gym, a very strong<LINE>and kind Gym Leader is waiting.<LINE>By the way, the Gym Leader Lenora<LINE>happens to be my wife!
At the end of the Gym, a very strong<LINE>and kind Gym Leader is waiting.<LINE>By the way, the Gym Leader Lenora<LINE>happens to be my wife!
Lenora: Now, you wait!<LINE>Enough fooling around!
Team Plasma: So you've come, Gym Leader.<LINE>We, Team Plasma, claim this museum's<LINE>Dragon Skull in the name of<LINE><LINE>Pokémon liberation!
Team Plasma: To show you we're serious,<LINE>we'll steal it right before your eyes!
Team Plasma: Well, then, here's<LINE>our smoke screen!
Plasmaaaa!
Plasmaaaa!
Lenora: What's going on?
Hawes: Oh! Oh! We have to go after them!
Hawes: Lenora loves that skull...
Bianca: I won't forgive those thieves!
Cheren: So I can't battle the Gym Leader<LINE>because of Team Plasma, huh...<LINE>What a bother.
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious...<LINE>From the outside, you can't see their<LINE>functional, efficient design.<LINE>It's almost as if it is an embodiment of<LINE>their former essence... So fascinating!
Rare Pokémon from around the world...<LINE>Museums are packed with adventure!
My oh my oh my!
The Gym Leader here studies Fossils and<LINE>ancient artifacts.
Those thugs sure were bold...<LINE>It's almost as if they believe they are<LINE>doing the right thing.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came<LINE>from space along with this meteorite.
What in the world could Team Plasma<LINE>be thinking?!
This is a skeletal specimen from a<LINE>Pokémon that flew around the world.
Part of the skeleton was stolen by<LINE>Team Plasma and is missing!
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was<LINE>protected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus<LINE>attached to it.
An ancient round stone that was buried<LINE>in the desert.
A plate with an unknown script carved<LINE>into it.
A mask that ancient people used to wear<LINE>at festivals.
Bones that were once carried as weapons<LINE>by a certain kind of Pokémon.
