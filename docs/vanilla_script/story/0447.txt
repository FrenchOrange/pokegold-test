My Pok√©mon is always running off<LINE>to go play on its own.<LINE>But it always comes back before dark,<LINE>so I guess it's OK.

This is Lacunosa Town. Here, everyone<LINE>lives according to the rules, from the<LINE><LINE>moment they awaken to the time they<LINE><LINE>go to sleep.
At night, a scary monster comes out of<LINE>the big hole, so you have to go home<LINE><LINE>and be good!
