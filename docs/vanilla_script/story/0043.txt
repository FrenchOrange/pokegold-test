Burgh: Come on! This way!
Burgh: Team Plasma...<LINE>They took this young lady's Pokémon.
Bianca: <PLAYER>, is there<LINE>anything we can do? My Munna...<LINE>Team Plasma took it...
???: I heard this lady's scream and<LINE>ran after the thief as fast as I could.<LINE>But this city is so big and so crowded...<LINE>I'm afraid I lost them.
Burgh: Iris...<LINE>You did everything you could.
Iris: But that's so bad!<LINE>Taking people's Pokémon is really bad!<LINE>'Cause it's really nice when<LINE>people and Pokémon are together!<LINE>They each have something the other<LINE>doesn't, and they help each other!
Bianca: Iris...
Burgh: Agreed!<LINE>No fear--we will get that Pokémon back.
Right, <PLAYER>?
Right, <PLAYER>?
Having said that, finding a person or a<LINE>Pokémon here in Castelia City will be<LINE><LINE>like finding a needle in a haystack.
Team Plasma: I spy a Gym Leader?!<LINE>Last time went so well, I thought<LINE>I'd grab another Pokémon...<LINE><LINE>Rethinking...<LINE><LINE>I need to get out of here!
Burgh: <PLAYER>, let's go!<LINE>Iris! You stay by that young lady's side.
Burgh: <PLAYER>, let's go!<LINE>Iris! You stay by that young lady's side.
Iris: I'm gonna be Bianca's bodyguard.<LINE>So you go after those bad guys, OK?
Iris: I'm gonna be Bianca's bodyguard.<LINE>So you go after those bad guys, OK?
Iris: I'm gonna be Bianca's bodyguard.<LINE>So you go after those bad guys, OK?
Iris: I'm gonna be Bianca's bodyguard.<LINE>So you go after those bad guys, OK?
Bianca: Oh, Munna, I can't believe it.<LINE>Here I am, a Trainer, and I can't even<LINE>protect my own Pokémon... I'm sorry...
When someone is getting under your skin<LINE>and you want to yell at them,<LINE><LINE>scream at the ocean!<LINE>...When you're alone, of course.
That black boat...<LINE>What could it be?
