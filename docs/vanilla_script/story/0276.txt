I will look for a new start!<LINE>Patrat and I can do it together!<LINE>Thank you, VILLAGE BRIDGE, for making us<LINE>who we are…and farewell!
Swonweeya!
Doesn't this house have<LINE>great atmosphere?
Doesn't this entire room kind of smell<LINE>like Patrat?
Isn't it great that this house is on<LINE>the bridge?
Hmmm…<LINE>I am a bit concerned about the guy<LINE>singing outside…
We can move in here right away?!
This place isn't bad, but I'd prefer a<LINE>nice big villa in UNDELLA TOWN!
