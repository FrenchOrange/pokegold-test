Cheren: <PLAYER>!<LINE>This bothersome bunch doesn't<LINE>really listen to reason.
Team Plasma: That child cannot use<LINE>a Pokémon to its full potential.<LINE>Doesn't that make the Pokémon sad?<LINE>It's the same thing for all your Pokémon,<LINE>so hand them over to us now!<LINE>Better yet...<LINE>We'll just take them!
Team Plasma: Wha...? How could we lose<LINE>when we have right on our side?!
Cheren: Not bad, <PLAYER>.<LINE>OK, go return the Pokémon to that girl.
You don't need to return it!
Team Plasma: How troublesome.<LINE>Not only do you fail to understand, but<LINE>you actually got in our way, to boot.
Team Plasma: There's two of you<LINE>and two of us.<LINE>We'll show you our combined power<LINE>and teach you that we are right!
Cheren: So, there were more of them...<LINE>Still, why are Pokémon robbers<LINE>acting so self-righteous?
<PLAYER>!<LINE>We've been friends our whole lives.<LINE>We've got each other's back when it<LINE><LINE>counts. Let's show them how it's done!
Team Plasma: In order to liberate<LINE>Pokémon from foolish people,<LINE><LINE>we will take their Pokémon!
Cheren: Whatever...<LINE>What a waste of time.<LINE>Come on, what reason could possibly<LINE>justify stealing Pokémon from people?
Team Plasma: Pokémon Trainers<LINE>like you are making Pokémon suffer...
Cheren: What do you mean, Trainers are<LINE>making Pokémon suffer?<LINE><LINE>I don't get that at all!
Team Plasma: We'll give you back<LINE>the Pokémon...<LINE>But be aware of how this Pokémon suffers<LINE>from being used by people.
Team Plasma: Someday, open your eyes<LINE>to your own complicity.
Cheren: Trainers bring out<LINE>their Pokémon's strength.<LINE>Pokémon believe in their<LINE>Trainers and respond to that.<LINE>I don't understand what about<LINE>that makes Pokémon suffer!
OK, <PLAYER>,<LINE>I'll return the Pokémon.
