Isn't it great? Isn't it spacious?<LINE>This is my dad's villa, and<LINE>I can use it freely!
But when I came here, surprisingly there<LINE>was nothing to do, so now I'm bored.<LINE>As you may know, my dad is totally<LINE>obsessed with items at the ruins...
Hey, you're bored, aren't you?<LINE>Come here tomorrow, too!<LINE>I don't mind having a battle with you!

Ah... You are not bored...
Argh!<LINE>So frustrating! Whywhywhy?
You're awesome!<LINE>I don't mind giving you a little credit!
Oh, you seem to be having fun.
How are you, Trainer?<LINE>I've been so dreadfully bored in my<LINE>father's villa! May I join you?
How are you, Trainer?<LINE>I won't lose today.
In my father's villa, I have too much<LINE>time on my hands.<LINE>Please come for a visit tomorrow, too.<LINE>I will have a battle with you.

How are you?<LINE>I am pleased you came here today, too.<LINE>May I trouble you for another battle?<LINE>Let me see...<LINE>First, please have a battle<LINE>with my little brother!
None of the Riches is a match for you...<LINE>I admire your strength!
Oh, it's quite lively for some reason.
I truly appreciate you for having battles<LINE>with my grandchildren.<LINE>And now, I'd like to see in what ways<LINE>your skills exceed theirs.
Hoho! Do you have confidence<LINE>in winning against me?
Undella Town is a relaxing and<LINE>comfortable place.<LINE>But my grandchildren seem<LINE>somewhat bored.<LINE>Please come visit us tomorrow, too.<LINE>My grandchildren will be happy<LINE><LINE>to see you again.

Ho, ho. You are genuinely strong!<LINE>You look dependable!
Welcome back, young Trainer.<LINE>My grandchildren are itching to have<LINE>more battles with you.
Children of today are very strong in<LINE>Pokémon battles.<LINE>Hoho! I wonder if my grandchildren<LINE>can become Trainers like you?
Hoho!<LINE>Pokémon battles bring back memories.
I am so excited, my blood is boiling!<LINE>May I please trouble you for a battle?

Hoho! Youth!<LINE>However, next time won't be like this.
Hoho!<LINE>Pokémon battles with the entire family!<LINE>We all had a good time!
What's happening?<LINE>It's pretty lively.
Trainer, are you strong?<LINE>Then, try to defeat me!
Today, for sure, I am going to win!<LINE>Now, try to defeat me!
I may not look like it, but I am very<LINE>familiar with Pokémon.<LINE>I would like to have a battle with you<LINE>someday again.
I may not look like it, but I am very<LINE>familiar with Pokémon.<LINE>Please have a battle with me again.
Welcome.<LINE>Today for sure I'm going to show you<LINE>the real strength of the Riches!
I didn't expect you to be this strong...
It's a complete defeat...<LINE>The Riches sincerely wish every success<LINE>to you in the future.
You! Do you still call yourself<LINE>one of the Riches?
I am Miles, the next head of the Riches!<LINE>I will protect the honor of our family!
No matter how often you try, <LINE>you cannot defeat me!<LINE>I will protect the honor<LINE>of The Riches!
You may come back again tomorrow.<LINE>However, I have no intention of losing<LINE>in the name of the Riches.
You came!<LINE>If you can defeat my family,<LINE>I will let you have a battle with me.
Sigh.<LINE>I guess...it's still too early to identify<LINE>myself as the head of the family.
Sigh.<LINE>I guess...it's still too early to identify<LINE>myself as the head of the family.<LINE>You should be proud of yourself<LINE>for defeating the distinguished<LINE><LINE>Trainer family, the Riches!
