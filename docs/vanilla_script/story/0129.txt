I am coaching Iris.<LINE>But, honestly, she's been stronger than<LINE>me ever since she came here!
The move Draco Meteor that Drayden<LINE>teaches us is the strongest<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type move.<LINE>However, it will sharply reduce<LINE>Special Attack after use.

Concerned about your Pokémon's weight?<LINE>You don't need to put it on a diet!<LINE>Just let it hold this.
The weight of a Pokémon holding a<LINE>Float Stone will be halved!<LINE>That way, you can reduce the damage<LINE>caused by weight-based moves such as<LINE><LINE>Low Kick and Grass Knot.
I have an item that I don't know how to<LINE>use. Would you give it a try and see if<LINE><LINE>you can make it work?
I know...<LINE>You'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can<LINE>be hit even by a move that would usually<LINE><LINE>have no effect.<LINE>For example, a Normal-type move would<LINE>hit a Ghost-type Pokémon.<LINE>Mastering this item is a bit tough...<LINE>Actually, it's very tough, but think<LINE><LINE>how useful it could be!
