Man oh man…<LINE>What is going on today?<LINE>Challengers coming one<LINE>right after another.<LINE>Well, no matter.<LINE>I am GRIMSLEY of the Elite Four, and I will<LINE>fulfill my duty to be your opponent.
Whether or not you get to fight at full<LINE>strength, whether or not luck smiles<LINE><LINE>on you--none of that matters.<LINE>Only results matter. And a loss is a loss.<LINE>See, victory shines like a bright light.<LINE>And right now, you and your POKéMON<LINE>are shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than<LINE>the guy who lost…<LINE>Nothing more, nothing less.<LINE>Sigh…<LINE>You should take that strength and test<LINE>it against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing!<LINE>You have defeated every member of<LINE>the POKéMON LEAGUE's Elite Four.<LINE>But it isn't over yet.<LINE>There is one more opponent against whom<LINE>you must prove your strength.<LINE>The pinnacle of the POKéMON LEAGUE,<LINE>the Champion, ALDER…<LINE>Or, perhaps, that man called N has<LINE>defeated him and taken his title.<LINE>I don't know which one you will face, but<LINE>check the statue in the central plaza,<LINE><LINE>and continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have<LINE>to use the tools you're given.<LINE>It's more important to master the cards<LINE>you're holding than to complain about<LINE><LINE>the ones your opponents were dealt.<LINE>Let us begin.<LINE>And may the best Trainer win!<LINE>Contests like this are proof<LINE>that you are really living…
There are bad ways to win--<LINE>and good ways to lose.<LINE>What's interesting and troubling is that<LINE>it's not always clear which is which.<LINE>A flipped coin doesn't always land<LINE>heads or tails.<LINE>Sometimes it may never land at all…
Excellent!<LINE>The nice thing about POKéMON battles is<LINE>they teach the loser something, as well.<LINE>That said…<LINE>You should take that strength and test<LINE><LINE>it against the rest of the Elite Four!
