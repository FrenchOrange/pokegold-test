Hello, hello!<LINE>I am the official Name Rater!<LINE>Want me to rate the nicknames<LINE>of your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname<LINE>should I critique?
Hmmm. \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000, is it?<LINE>That sounds good! It's a very “you"<LINE>sort of name.<LINE>But if you'd like to change it, I can help<LINE>you do that. How about it?
Excellent! What would you like<LINE>the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon<LINE>shall be known as \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000!<LINE>You're right, that does seem to fit it<LINE>better. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you<LINE>change your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon<LINE>shall be known as \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000!<LINE>It looks no different from before, but we<LINE>both know this name is vastly superior!<LINE><LINE>How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000!<LINE>That is a truly impeccable nickname!<LINE>Take good care of \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000!
Now, now…<LINE>That is merely an Egg!
