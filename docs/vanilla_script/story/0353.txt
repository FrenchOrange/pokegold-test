You only have one Pokémon?<LINE>And you call yourself a Trainer?<LINE>Well, it's too dangerous for<LINE>you to go any further!
We're going to combine our strength<LINE>and do our best, so please watch!
Ummm...<LINE>One plus one is two, right?
Maybe I could have won if I had used<LINE>a Potion or something at some point?
It's hard to win in a Double Battle if<LINE>one Pokémon faints.
Cheren: <PLAYER>, stop!<LINE>We both have a Trio Badge,<LINE>so let's see which of us is stronger!
Cheren: I see.<LINE>So that's how you battle.
???: Out of the way!
Cheren: What was that about?
Bianca?<LINE>Why are you running?
Bianca: Hey!<LINE>Where were those people headed?
Cheren: That way, but...
Why are you running now?
Bianca: Oh, seriously!<LINE>They run so fast!
Little Girl: Miss... Oh...<LINE>My Pokémon?
Bianca: It'll be OK.<LINE>It'll be OK. Don't cry.
Cheren: Bianca, really, why<LINE>were you running?
Bianca: You have to hear this!<LINE>Those people stole this girl's Pokémon!
Cheren: You should have<LINE>spoken up sooner!
<PLAYER>, we're going to get<LINE>that Pokémon back.<LINE>Bianca! Please stay by the girl's side.
Bianca: Please, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Team Plasma took that Pokémon.<LINE>Get it back!
Bianca: Please, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Team Plasma took that Pokémon.<LINE>Get it back!
Little Girl: Oh, why do they<LINE>take people's Pokémon?
Cheren: They ran inside here!<LINE><PLAYER>, your Pokémon's HP is fine,<LINE>and you're ready to go, right?
Then let's go.
I could never forgive myself if we were<LINE>to lose to the kinds of thugs who would<LINE><LINE>take people's Pokémon!<LINE>I'll wait here. Hurry and get ready!

Cheren: <PLAYER>, your Pokémon's HP<LINE>is fine, and you're ready to go, right?
Bianca: <PLAYER>, thank you so much!<LINE>The two of you got her Pokémon back!<LINE>I'm lucky to have friends like you two!
Little Girl: Thank you, mister! Please<LINE>take these as a thank-you present.
Little Girl: Thank you, miss! Please<LINE>take these as a thank-you present.
Bianca: Ooh! Those are Heal Balls!<LINE>They completely heal the captured<LINE>Pokémon on the spot! How sweet of you!<LINE>I'm going to see this girl on her way,<LINE>so see you later, <PLAYER>. Bye-bye!
Cheren: <PLAYER>, stop!
That dark tall grass over there...<LINE>Every now and again, two Pokémon<LINE>will pop out at the same time.
In other words, you have to be<LINE>careful in the darker grass.<LINE>I'm heading on to Nacrene City.
Heeey, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Come here!
Heeey, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Come here!
Pokémon battling is very popular<LINE>at this Day Care.<LINE>If you go in the playground, you'll<LINE>be pestered into battling.
You w-want to have a Double Battle?<LINE>Our P-Pokémon aren't strong enough yet.<LINE>Maybe we'll leave them at the Day Care.
Our perfectly matched combination<LINE>flusters all the other Trainers!
Sometimes they let<LINE>us play with Pokémon!
