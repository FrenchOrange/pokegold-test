PROFESSOR JUNIPER: Ah, <PLAYER>!<LINE>There you are!<LINE>Traveling with your POKéMON is truly one<LINE>of the joys of being a Trainer!<LINE>Please follow me.<LINE>I'd like to show you the most important<LINE>place for a Trainer to know!
Please listen, everyone.<LINE>We have something important to talk<LINE>to you about. Wait here for a moment.
Please excuse me…<LINE>We are still preparing.<LINE>If you could continue to be patient…
Please excuse me…<LINE>We are still preparing.<LINE>If you could continue to be patient…

CHEREN: Wasn't that the PROFESSOR<LINE>waiting in front of the POKéMON CENTER?<LINE>I know about the POKéMON CENTER<LINE>already. Anyway, I want to battle soon!<LINE>Real battles are the best way to become<LINE>stronger, you know!
Sounds like something's going<LINE>on in the plaza!
Well, let's have a little look-see.
CHEREN: <PLAYER>, come here a sec.
My name is GHETSIS.<LINE>I am here representing TEAM PLASMA.<LINE>Today, ladies and gentlemen, I would like<LINE>to talk to you about POKéMON liberation.
Huh?
What?
GHETSIS: I'm sure most of you believe<LINE>that we humans and POKéMON are partners<LINE><LINE>that have come to live together because<LINE><LINE>we want and need each other.<LINE>However…<LINE>Is that really the truth?<LINE>Have you ever considered that perhaps<LINE>we humans…<LINE><LINE>only assume that this is the truth?
POKéMON are subject to the selfish<LINE>commands of Trainers…<LINE>They get pushed around when they are<LINE>our “partners" at work…<LINE>Can anyone say with confidence that<LINE>there is no truth in what I'm saying?
Yikes!
No way.
I don't know…
GHETSIS: Now, ladies and gentlemen,<LINE>POKéMON are different from humans.<LINE>They are living beings that contain<LINE>unknown potential.<LINE>They are living beings from whom we<LINE>humans have much to learn.<LINE>Tell me, what is our responsibility toward<LINE>these wonderful beings called POKéMON?
What could it be?
Liberation?
GHETSIS: That's right!<LINE>We must liberate the POKéMON!<LINE>Then, and only then, will humans<LINE>and POKéMON truly be equals.<LINE>Everyone, I end my words here today by<LINE>imploring you to consider the relationship<LINE><LINE>between people and POKéMON…<LINE><LINE>and the correct way to proceed.<LINE>We sincerely appreciate your attention.
Older Man: About that speech…<LINE>What do you think we should do?
Younger Man: Liberate POKéMON?<LINE>That's not even possible!
???: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001Your POKéMON…<LINE>Just now, it was saying…\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
CHEREN: Slow down. You talk too fast.<LINE>And what's this about POKéMON…talking?<LINE>That's an odd thing to say.
???: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001Yes, they're talking.<LINE>Oh.<LINE>Then, you two can't hear it, either…<LINE><LINE>How sad.<LINE>My name is N.\xf000븉\x0001\x0001
CHEREN: My name is CHEREN,<LINE>and this is <PLAYER>.<LINE>We were asked to complete the POKéDEX,<LINE>and we just left on our journey.<LINE>My main goal is to become the<LINE>Champion, though.
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001The POKéDEX, eh?<LINE>So… You're going to confine many, many<LINE>POKéMON in POKé BALLS for that, then.<LINE>I'm a Trainer, too,<LINE>but I can't help wondering…<LINE>Are POKéMON really happy that way?\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001Well, <PLAYER>, is it?<LINE>Let me hear your POKéMON's voice again!\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
N: \xf000븉\x0001\x0001As long as POKéMON are confined<LINE>in POKé BALLS…<LINE>POKéMON will never become<LINE>perfect beings.<LINE>I have to change the world for<LINE>POKéMON, because they're my friends.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
CHEREN: Huh… Strange guy.<LINE>But I'm not going to worry about it.<LINE>Trainers and POKéMON help<LINE>each other out!<LINE>Listen, I'm going on ahead.<LINE>I want to battle the GYM LEADER<LINE>in the next town--STRIATON CITY.<LINE>Aim to battle GYM LEADER after<LINE>GYM LEADER. The best way for a Trainer<LINE><LINE>to become stronger is to challenge<LINE><LINE>the GYM LEADERs in each area.
What's this?<LINE>You and your POKéMON<LINE>somehow resemble each other!
Let me give you the benefit of<LINE>my experience.<LINE>You listening? The number of POKéMON<LINE>you can take with you at one time is six!
POKéMON do everything in<LINE>their power for people.<LINE>People treat these POKéMON<LINE>with love and affection.<LINE>That's what I think our<LINE>mutual relationship is.
Beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds…<LINE>Oh, man. I sure do loooove this place.<LINE>Sure makes me feel happy.
Some wild POKéMON jump out of the<LINE>tall grass and attack…<LINE>But you can make friends with those<LINE>POKéMON if you reach out to them!
