I want to know the future!<LINE>I am very worried...<LINE>I wonder how my child, Thyme, will spend<LINE>the future.<LINE>I'm making a machine that connects the<LINE>future and the present, but electricity<LINE><LINE>is desperately short.
I've heard that in another world,<LINE>there's another Opelucid City that looks<LINE><LINE>very futuristic.<LINE>If there is a Pokémon from that world<LINE>that knows the move Charge, the machine<LINE><LINE>may work.<LINE>If you're able, would you be willing to<LINE>lend me a Pokémon like that?
I...I see. What a pity.<LINE>If you change your mind, please return.
Th-thank you!<LINE>Now my machine will work!
I appreciate the thought, but...you<LINE>don't have a Pokémon that meets the<LINE><LINE>conditions I need.
I appreciate the thought, but although<LINE>your Pokémon knows Charge, it's not from<LINE><LINE>that other world...
Now, please show me the future!
Whirrr, whirrr, whirrr...
Oh! So that's what the future is like!<LINE>My precious Thyme is growing up as such<LINE>a good kid!
Oh, it returned to normal...<LINE>But what an experience!<LINE>I can't stop trembling!<LINE>And even though I know the future,<LINE>I guess my present time won't change.
I will return your Pokémon to you.<LINE>This is my thank-you gift.
Rather than worrying about the future,<LINE>it is important to live in the present,<LINE><LINE>which connects to the future, as best<LINE><LINE>you can.<LINE>OK, Thyme! Let's go out later!<LINE>Today, let's play as hard as we can!
Thyme: I, I...<LINE>What will I be when I grow up?
I want to return to the past!<LINE>I want to do many things over again!<LINE>My father, Bach, created a machine to<LINE>see the future.<LINE>I am making a machine to connect with<LINE>the past.<LINE>...But I don't have enough electricity.
I've heard that in another world,<LINE>there's another Opelucid City that looks<LINE><LINE>very old-timey.<LINE>If there is a Pokémon from that world<LINE>that knows the move Charge, the machine<LINE><LINE>may work.<LINE>If you're able, would you be willing to<LINE>lend me a Pokémon like that?
Ah... What a pity.<LINE>There is no other way...
Yes!<LINE>Now, the machine will work.
You're nice to offer, but I'm afraid you<LINE>don't have a Pokémon that meets the<LINE><LINE>conditions I need.
That's nice of you, but although your<LINE>Pokémon knows Charge, it's not from<LINE><LINE>that other world...
Now, we can connect with the past!
We connected with the past!<LINE>Father! It's me, Thyme!<LINE>I owe you an apology...
It returned to normal...<LINE>It seems to have run out of electricity.<LINE>I connected with the past...but I guess<LINE>my present time won't change.
Oh!<LINE>I will return your Pokémon to you.<LINE>Thank you.<LINE>This is my thank-you gift.
Rather than regretting the past...<LINE>it is important to live in the present,<LINE><LINE>which connects from the past,<LINE><LINE>as best as you can.<LINE>OK!<LINE>I'll live positively!
I heard that my father had a fight with<LINE>my Grandpa Bach a long, long time ago!
