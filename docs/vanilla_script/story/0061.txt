GHETSIS: My word, if it isn't<LINE>the GYM LEADER, BURGH.
BURGH: So, what would you say is the<LINE>guiding principle of TEAM PLASMA, anyway?<LINE>“Take what you want from people"?
Bronius: I thought it would be amusing<LINE>to prepare a hideout right in front of a<LINE><LINE>POKéMON Gym, but we were detected<LINE><LINE>more quickly than I imagined.
GHETSIS: Indeed…<LINE>No matter. We already have an<LINE>exceptional base of operations.<LINE>Is everyone familiar with the legend<LINE>of the founding of the Unova region?
IRIS: I am! It's the white<LINE>Dragon-type POKéMON, right?
IRIS: I am! It's the black<LINE>Dragon-type POKéMON, right?
GHETSIS: The truth is this…<LINE>The white dragon appeared before a hero<LINE>who sought the true way to knit together<LINE><LINE>a world full of many warring people.<LINE>This white Dragon-type POKéMON shared<LINE>its knowledge--and bared its fangs<LINE><LINE>at those who stood against it.<LINE>Together, the power of this POKéMON and<LINE>the hero brought unity to the hearts of<LINE><LINE>everyone in the land,<LINE><LINE>and that is how Unova was created.
GHETSIS: The truth is this…<LINE>The black dragon appeared before a hero<LINE>who sought the ideal way to knit<LINE><LINE>together a world full of warring people.<LINE>This black Dragon-type POKéMON shared<LINE>its knowledge--and bared its fangs<LINE><LINE>at those who stood against it.<LINE>Together, the power of this POKéMON and<LINE>the hero brought unity to the hearts of<LINE><LINE>everyone in the land,<LINE><LINE>and that is how Unova was created.
We shall bring back the hero and<LINE>that POKéMON to Unova once again!<LINE>If we can win people's hearts and minds,<LINE>we can easily create the world that<LINE><LINE>I--I mean, TEAM PLASMA--desires!
BURGH: Here in CASTELIA, we have<LINE>a lot of different kinds of people.<LINE>Everyone's ways of thinking and<LINE>lifestyles are very different.<LINE>Honestly, there's something about what<LINE>you're saying I don't quite understand.
Yes?
What is it?
BURGH: One thing we all have in<LINE>common is that we all care a lot<LINE><LINE>about POKéMON.<LINE>Even people meeting for the first time<LINE>can talk about POKéMON.<LINE><LINE>Talk or battle or trade…
Remember your speech at ACCUMULA TOWN?<LINE>You were responsible for leading me to<LINE>rethink my relationship with POKéMON.<LINE><LINE>For that, I thank you.<LINE>At that time, I made a promise…<LINE>I swore to myself that I would dedicate<LINE>myself to POKéMON even more strongly!<LINE>What you guys are doing… Aren't you<LINE>going to strengthen the bond between<LINE><LINE>people and POKéMON even more?
GHETSIS: Myah-ha-ha-ha!<LINE>You are quite hard to figure out--a little<LINE>more intelligent than I'd expected.<LINE>I am fond of intelligent people, you see.<LINE>You'll enjoy hearing about this…<LINE>From every corner of the world,<LINE>I have gathered knowledgeable people<LINE><LINE>for our king's benefit.<LINE>You could call them the Seven Sages.<LINE>Very well! We will submit to your<LINE>opinion and be on our way.
That girl over there…<LINE>Return her POKéMON!
BIANCA: Th-thank you!<LINE>Munny, I'm so glad to see you again!
IRIS: BIANCA!<LINE>Why are you thanking them?<LINE>They take people's precious POKéMON!
BIANCA: It's just… I'm…I'm so happy<LINE>that my Munna is safe.
GHETSIS: The friendship between POKéMON<LINE>and people can be very touching.<LINE>But, in order to liberate POKéMON from<LINE>foolish people, we will revive the legend<LINE><LINE>of Unova--and win the hearts and minds<LINE><LINE>of everyone. Farewell…
IRIS: What are you doing?<LINE>Why are you letting them get away?!
BURGH: Gah!<LINE>What do we do if anything's happened<LINE>to the other stolen POKéMON?
BIANCA: It's OK. Thank you, IRIS!<LINE>No one was hurt. More than anything,<LINE>I got my darling POKéMON back again!
IRIS: OK, if you're happy…
BURGH: What is everyone<LINE>planning to do now?
BIANCA: Oh, it would be sensational to<LINE>look around CASTELIA CITY, but…
IRIS: Don't worry!<LINE>I'll keep on being your bodyguard!
BIANCA: IRIS…
BURGH: Uh-hm. That's great!<LINE>IRIS is a dazzling POKéMON Trainer,<LINE>but maybe not at home in the<LINE><LINE>big city yet.<LINE>So, a little give-and-take, hm! People and<LINE>POKéMON need to help each other out!
IRIS: Also, thanks for looking<LINE>for the POKéMON!<LINE>Here, this is for you!
IRIS: Also, thanks for looking<LINE>for the POKéMON!<LINE>Here, this is for you!
IRIS: See you!
Wha…
Waaait!
BURGH: Well, then, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'll be waiting in the Gym.
BURGH: Well, then, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'll be waiting in the Gym.
