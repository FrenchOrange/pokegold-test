Ghetsis: My word, if it isn't<LINE>the Gym Leader, Burgh.
Burgh: So, what would you say is the<LINE>guiding principle of Team Plasma, anyway?<LINE>“Take what you want from people"?
Bronius: I thought it would be amusing<LINE>to prepare a hideout right in front of a<LINE><LINE>Pokémon Gym, but we were detected<LINE><LINE>more quickly than I imagined.
Ghetsis: Indeed...<LINE>No matter. We already have an<LINE>exceptional base of operations.<LINE>Is everyone familiar with the legend<LINE>of the founding of the Unova region?
Iris: I am! It's the white<LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon, right?
Iris: I am! It's the black<LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon, right?
Ghetsis: The truth is this...<LINE>The white dragon appeared before a hero<LINE>who sought the true way to knit together<LINE><LINE>a world full of many warring people.<LINE>This white Dragon-type Pokémon shared<LINE>its knowledge--and bared its fangs<LINE><LINE>at those who stood against it.<LINE>Together, the power of this Pokémon and<LINE>the hero brought unity to the hearts of<LINE><LINE>everyone in the land,<LINE><LINE>and that is how Unova was created.
Ghetsis: The truth is this...<LINE>The black dragon appeared before a hero<LINE>who sought the ideal way to knit<LINE><LINE>together a world full of warring people.<LINE>This black Dragon-type Pokémon shared<LINE>its knowledge--and bared its fangs<LINE><LINE>at those who stood against it.<LINE>Together, the power of this Pokémon and<LINE>the hero brought unity to the hearts of<LINE><LINE>everyone in the land,<LINE><LINE>and that is how Unova was created.
We shall bring back the hero and<LINE>that Pokémon to Unova once again!<LINE>If we can win people's hearts and minds,<LINE>we can easily create the world that<LINE><LINE>I--I mean, Team Plasma--desires!
Burgh: Here in Castelia, we have<LINE>a lot of different kinds of people.<LINE>Everyone's ways of thinking and<LINE>lifestyles are very different.<LINE>Honestly, there's something about what<LINE>you're saying I don't quite understand.
Yes?
What is it?
Burgh: One thing we all have in<LINE>common is that we all care a lot<LINE><LINE>about Pokémon.<LINE>Even people meeting for the first time<LINE>can talk about Pokémon.<LINE><LINE>Talk or battle or trade...
Remember your speech at Accumula Town?<LINE>You were responsible for leading me to<LINE>rethink my relationship with Pokémon.<LINE><LINE>For that, I thank you.<LINE>At that time, I made a promise...<LINE>I swore to myself that I would dedicate<LINE>myself to Pokémon even more strongly!<LINE>What you guys are doing... Aren't you<LINE>going to strengthen the bond between<LINE><LINE>people and Pokémon even more?
Ghetsis: Myah-ha-ha-ha!<LINE>You are quite hard to figure out--a little<LINE>more intelligent than I'd expected.<LINE>I am fond of intelligent people, you see.<LINE>You'll enjoy hearing about this...<LINE>From every corner of the world,<LINE>I have gathered knowledgeable people<LINE><LINE>for our king's benefit.<LINE>You could call them the Seven Sages.<LINE>Very well! We will submit to your<LINE>opinion and be on our way.
That girl over there...<LINE>Return her Pokémon!
Bianca: Th-thank you!<LINE>Munny, I'm so glad to see you again!
Iris: Bianca!<LINE>Why are you thanking them?<LINE>They take people's precious Pokémon!
Bianca: It's just... I'm...I'm so happy<LINE>that my Munna is safe.
Ghetsis: The friendship between Pokémon<LINE>and people can be very touching.<LINE>But, in order to liberate Pokémon from<LINE>foolish people, we will revive the legend<LINE><LINE>of Unova--and win the hearts and minds<LINE><LINE>of everyone. Farewell...
Iris: What are you doing?<LINE>Why are you letting them get away?!
Burgh: Gah!<LINE>What do we do if anything's happened<LINE>to the other stolen Pokémon?
Bianca: It's OK. Thank you, Iris!<LINE>No one was hurt. More than anything,<LINE>I got my darling Pokémon back again!
Iris: OK, if you're happy...
Burgh: What is everyone<LINE>planning to do now?
Bianca: Oh, it would be sensational to<LINE>look around Castelia City, but...
Iris: Don't worry!<LINE>I'll keep on being your bodyguard!
Bianca: Iris...
Burgh: Uh-hm. That's great!<LINE>Iris is a dazzling Pokémon Trainer,<LINE>but maybe not at home in the<LINE><LINE>big city yet.<LINE>So, a little give-and-take, hm! People and<LINE>Pokémon need to help each other out!
Iris: Also, thanks for looking<LINE>for the Pokémon!<LINE>Here, this is for you!
Iris: Also, thanks for looking<LINE>for the Pokémon!<LINE>Here, this is for you!
Iris: See you!
Wha...
Waaait!
Burgh: Well, then, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'll be waiting in the Gym.
Burgh: Well, then, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'll be waiting in the Gym.
