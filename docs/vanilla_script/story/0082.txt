Bianca: A. Mazing. Isn't it?
Hello, you two! How do you do?<LINE>I'm the owner of this theater.<LINE>Pleasure to meet you!
Ooh! I must say that you two seem like<LINE>phenomenal Trainers!<LINE>What do we do here? We use Props to make<LINE>your Pokémon fashionable and glamorous!<LINE>Do you want to join in and play Dress Up?<LINE>To get you started, here's a Prop Case!
This Prop Case lets you store Props for<LINE>decorating your Pokémon!<LINE>First off, you need to pick a Pokémon!
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't<LINE>play Dress Up. Please choose a<LINE><LINE>different Pokémon next time.
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing<LINE>your Pokémon's innate charm by choosing<LINE><LINE>not to decorate it!<LINE>Honestly, though, I think using Props<LINE>would be better received in this musical.
Now, now. Don't be like that.<LINE>Please reconsider and select a Pokémon!
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!
Wow! The two of you did a fantastic job<LINE>coordinating everything!<LINE><LINE>Utterly charming!
If you have a Pokémon who can play<LINE>Dress Up, you can participate in the<LINE><LINE>Pokémon Musical!<LINE>Would you two please join us?<LINE>The receptionist can explain everything.<LINE>Let us say a brief farewell!<LINE>I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!
Bianca: Oh, I don't know what to do!<LINE>Doing the musical would be totally cool,<LINE>but there's other stuff I wanna do.<LINE>OK, that's it! I made up my mind!<LINE>I'm going to see the sights in Nimbasa!<LINE>See ya, <PLAYER>!
We really want you to participate in<LINE>the musical!<LINE>I apologize in advance if any of our<LINE>Props don't suit some kinds of Pokémon.<LINE>Pokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait!<LINE>You participated in a musical<LINE>with your friends, right?<LINE>I felt like you opened up new possibilities<LINE>for musicals!<LINE>That's why I feel impelled to give you<LINE>this present! Please accept it!
I eagerly anticipate seeing you<LINE>on stage again!
Your continued participation makes me<LINE>a happy owner!<LINE>You're attracting a lot of attention as<LINE>an up-and-coming stylist.<LINE>Of course, I'm watching you closely,<LINE>as well.<LINE>Please accept this as a token of<LINE>my appreciation.
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you<LINE>on stage again!<LINE>...Actually, it feels like I've said this<LINE>line before.<LINE>Well, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation<LINE>makes me a happy owner.<LINE>Apparently, some audience members have<LINE>been calling you a top stylist as of late!<LINE>Best of all... How impressive am I for<LINE>recognizing your talent?<LINE>Please accept this as a token of<LINE>my gratitude!
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday!<LINE>I've got this festive Prop to give you!<LINE>It's a cake from me, the owner!<LINE>Of course, this is a Prop, so you should<LINE>attach it to your Pokémon and not eat it.<LINE>By the way, even if today isn't your<LINE>birthday, I won't take it back!<LINE>Why?<LINE>Because I'm the owner!
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous<LINE>than ever before, so I'm researching the<LINE><LINE>styles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up<LINE>there today!<LINE>Overall, totally \xf000ģ\x0001\x0000!<LINE>The \xf000ģ\x0001\x0001 Prop<LINE>was a great accent.<LINE>I noticed that your \xf000ģ\x0001\x0002<LINE>factor was a bit subdued today.<LINE>OK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the<LINE>show you're performing in is im-por-tant!<LINE>If it's a good match, you can win the<LINE>hearts of the audience!<LINE><LINE>You'll be sure to attract attention.<LINE>If you're going to get on stage,<LINE>it's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image:<LINE>cool, cute, elegant, or quirky.<LINE>Before you play Dress Up, take a moment<LINE>to think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're<LINE>rather rich.<LINE>When you say rich people, you think<LINE>musical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have<LINE>played Dress Up with their Pokémon<LINE><LINE>with such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful!<LINE>I'm always watching them.<LINE>I hope you can keep entertaining us with<LINE>your performances.
I always make sure to watch the<LINE>shows you participate in!<LINE>Even from the perspective of a rich man<LINE>like me, it's impressive!<LINE>It's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from<LINE>last time!
You can hang Musical Photos from your<LINE>previous shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon,<LINE>my eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this<LINE>Musical Theater.<LINE>One time, a Pokémon wandered up on<LINE>stage and started imitating the actors.<LINE>Everybody thought it was sensational!<LINE>Ta-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people<LINE>will become your fans and give you Props.<LINE>I don't have any Props, so I'll give you<LINE>this instead!
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is<LINE>boosted more and more if it's used<LINE><LINE>every turn.<LINE>Having a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep<LINE>participating in the musical, and keep<LINE><LINE>using Echoed Voice!<LINE>You'll make more fans in the musical, and<LINE>you'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater<LINE>Props + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance,<LINE>but I think you belong on the<LINE><LINE>spectacular stage!
