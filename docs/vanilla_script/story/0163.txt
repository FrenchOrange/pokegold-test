In order to eliminate the old-fashioned<LINE>ways of looking at things…
We will steal Pokémon!<LINE>You'll never play together again!
If their Pokémon are liberated,<LINE>Trainers will no longer be Trainers!
We are in the right!
Everyone else is wrong!
If you don't think the same way we think,<LINE>we'll use all our power to eliminate you!
Burgh: Well, you see…<LINE>There are two ways out of<LINE>Pinwheel Forest--<LINE>the road that goes straight and the<LINE>path that winds through the woods.
I will take the straight road after them!
If they're not there,<LINE>I'll block the exit.
Would you please take the other way<LINE>and check whether Team Plasma<LINE><LINE>is hiding in there somewhere?<LINE>You'll run into a lot of Trainers,<LINE>but it's basically a single path,<LINE><LINE>so I'm sure you won't get lost.
Come on!<LINE>Let's do this for Lenora's sake!
Burgh: Mm-hmm?<LINE>Team Plasma hasn't come<LINE>in this direction…<LINE>The forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Burgh: Mm-hmm?<LINE>Team Plasma hasn't come<LINE>in this direction…<LINE>The forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Team Plasma: You stubborn brat!<LINE>When I'm through with you,<LINE>you won't be able to chase us anymore!
Team Plasma: Too bad!<LINE>I haven't got anything!<LINE>If you want to get it back,<LINE>you're just gonna have<LINE><LINE>to look for my associates!
Team Plasma: My, my.<LINE>Could you be looking for something?
Team Plasma: Sorry!<LINE>I'm empty handed.<LINE>Do I look like the kind of girl<LINE>to carry a heavy load?<LINE>Better try somewhere else!
Team Plasma: So you made it this far!<LINE>I'll hold you here so my friends<LINE>can get away!
Team Plasma: Yep! I'm here to buy time!<LINE>And if you don't step lively,<LINE>we're going to get away!
Team Plasma: A pursuer?<LINE>Uh, ha ha. A kid like you--<LINE>beat some of us?!<LINE>That can't be helped, but…<LINE>I'll take you on now!
Team Plasma: Fine.<LINE>Take your stupid skull!
Team Plasma: So the dream our king had--<LINE>the dream we had--won't come true…
Gorm: How are you holding up,<LINE>fellow subject of our king?
Team Plasma: Gorm of the Seven Sages!<LINE>I'm mortified that this skull, which we<LINE>went to so much trouble to obtain,<LINE><LINE>was stolen from us so easily.
Gorm: It's not important.<LINE>We can afford to abandon<LINE>the Dragon Skull.<LINE>According to the results of our<LINE>research, this is not the legendary<LINE><LINE>Pokémon for which Team Plasma is looking.<LINE><LINE>It is completely unrelated.
But we will not allow anyone to disrupt<LINE>our plans and get away with it.<LINE>We will fix it so you never interfere<LINE>with us again.
Burgh: Oh, sweet!<LINE>The bug Pokémon were getting<LINE>all worked up, so here I come,<LINE><LINE>and what do I spy with my little eye?<LINE>This important-looking guy!<LINE>Are you here to help your friends,<LINE>whom I defeated?
Lenora: <PLAYER>!<LINE>Burgh!<LINE>The others didn't have anything…<LINE>And who are you supposed to be?<LINE>Is this guy the big boss?
Gorm: I am one of the Seven Sages<LINE>of Team Plasma.<LINE>Ghetsis, another of the Seven Sages,<LINE>will liberate Pokémon with words alone!<LINE>The remainder of the Seven Sages have<LINE>ordered their compatriots to take<LINE><LINE>Pokémon with full force!<LINE>But the odds are a little against us now.<LINE>To you, the Bug Pokémon user Burgh and<LINE>the Normal Pokémon user Lenora, I say…<LINE>Know your enemies, know yourself,<LINE>and you need not fear the result<LINE><LINE>of a hundred battles…<LINE><LINE>This time, we shall retreat quietly.
To secure the liberation of Pokémon,<LINE>we will steal Pokémon from Trainers!<LINE>Even though you are Gym Leaders,<LINE>we will not tolerate any further<LINE><LINE>obstruction from you.<LINE>In any case, we will settle this someday.<LINE>I hope you are looking forward<LINE>to that time as much as I…
Lenora: They're a speedy bunch.<LINE>What are you planning to do, Burgh?<LINE>Are you going to chase them?
Burgh: Hmmm…<LINE>We got back the stolen skull,<LINE>and if we corner them, there's<LINE><LINE>no telling what they might do.<LINE>I think I'll be heading back, Lenora…
Well, now. Well…<LINE>I'll be waiting for your challenge at<LINE><LINE>Castelia City's Pokémon Gym.<LINE>Yes, indeed.<LINE>I'm certainly looking forward to it!
Lenora: <PLAYER>!<LINE>You're holding the Dragon Skull you<LINE>worked so hard to get back, right?
<PLAYER> gave the<LINE>\xf000ĉ\x0001\x0001 to Lenora!
Lenora: <PLAYER>, thank you so much.<LINE>With a kind Trainer like you<LINE>taking care of them, the Pokémon<LINE><LINE>with you must be happy.<LINE>Here is a token of my gratitude.<LINE>Please use it carefully!
Lenora: This is a Moon Stone!<LINE>Some Pokémon evolve when you<LINE>use this item on them.<LINE>Now, I must take the Dragon Skull<LINE>back to the museum!<LINE>See you! Take care of yourself!
I run every day!<LINE>My goal is to be the marathon champion<LINE><LINE>of the Unova region!
The trees cut on this forest road are<LINE>sent from Driftveil City to the world.
Have you heard of phytoncides?<LINE>I don't really understand, but I heard<LINE>that the reason forests make you<LINE><LINE>feel good is phytoncides!
Hmm… I can feel it…<LINE>The presence of fierce Pokémon.
The surface is covered with moss.<LINE>Touching it feels good somehow.
