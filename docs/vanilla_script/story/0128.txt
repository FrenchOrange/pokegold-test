Drayden: I'll explain.<LINE>What you are holding is the Dark Stone.<LINE>Zekrom, who will likely awaken from the<LINE>Dark Stone, and Reshiram, who is already<LINE><LINE>awake, were once the same Pokémon.

Iris: That single Dragon Pokémon,<LINE>along with twin heroes,<LINE><LINE>brought a new region into being.<LINE>And people and Pokémon had happy lives!
Drayden: One day, however...<LINE>The twin heroes, the older brother<LINE>who sought the truth, and the<LINE><LINE>younger brother who sought ideals,<LINE><LINE>began to argue about how to decide<LINE><LINE>which one of them was right...<LINE>The single Dragon-type Pokémon<LINE>that had been with them all that time<LINE><LINE>split its body into two.<LINE>One sided with the older brother,<LINE>and the other with the younger brother.

Iris: In its pursuit of truth, the white<LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon sought to usher<LINE><LINE>in a new and better world...<LINE>Its name was Reshiram.<LINE>And the other, the black Dragon-type<LINE>Pokémon, sought ideals and<LINE><LINE>to usher in a new world--a world of hope.<LINE>Its name was Zekrom.
Iris: In its pursuit of ideals, the black<LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon sought to usher<LINE><LINE>in a new and better world...<LINE>Its name was Zekrom.<LINE>And the other, the white Dragon-type<LINE>Pokémon, sought truth, and to<LINE><LINE>usher in a new world--a world of good...<LINE>Its name was Reshiram.
Drayden: Because the two of them<LINE>were once the same entity,<LINE><LINE>their battle raged endlessly<LINE><LINE>and neither one could be<LINE><LINE>declared the winner.<LINE><LINE>They simply exhausted themselves.<LINE>The twin heroes proclaimed that there<LINE>was no one side that was right<LINE><LINE>and ceased the conflict.
Iris: But, but...<LINE>The two heroes' sons started the<LINE>battle again! And an instant later,<LINE><LINE>Reshiram and Zekrom destroyed<LINE><LINE>Unova with fire and lightning!<LINE>Then, they disappeared!<LINE>But, but...<LINE>If people work with Pokémon<LINE><LINE>in the right way, we don't have to worry<LINE><LINE>anymore about the world being destroyed.<LINE>I mean, Reshiram and Zekrom<LINE>worked hard for everyone<LINE><LINE>and made a new region!<LINE>So, it should be all right, I think.

Drayden: True.<LINE>Pokémon cannot speak.<LINE>People may hurt Pokémon even more by<LINE>imposing their selfish thoughts on them.<LINE>But, no matter what, Pokémon and people<LINE>believe in each other, need each other,<LINE><LINE>and will continue to live together...
Iris: Yeah!<LINE>So I'm never gonna forgive Team Plasma<LINE>for trying to separate Pokémon and us!
Drayden: Sorry.<LINE>We got a little off topic at the end.<LINE>That is everything we know.<LINE>Unfortunately, we don't know how<LINE>to wake up the legendary Pokémon...
Drayden: I made a promise to Alder.<LINE>You must win the Gym Badge from<LINE>the Opelucid Pokémon Gym.
Iris, you go and be <PLAYER>'s<LINE>opponent at the Pokémon Gym.
Iris: Yay!<LINE>Look out! I'm really, really strong,<LINE>just like Drayden!
<PLAYER>, I'll be waiting for<LINE>your challenge at the Pokémon Gym!
Drayden: What will it accomplish<LINE>to separate the worlds of people<LINE><LINE>and Pokémon?<LINE>The way we live now, with different beings<LINE>understanding and forgiving each other,<LINE><LINE>is much richer. That's my belief.
Iris: Everyone, people and Pokémon can<LINE>get along and be happy. That's awesome!
