Well, let's begin!
You think about battles very thoroughly.<LINE>I lost, but I learned a lot from you.<LINE>Besides, it was fun!<LINE>Come back again tomorrow.
No?<LINE>I've been raising Pokémon, thinking about<LINE>their Abilities and just the right<LINE><LINE>combination of held items.<LINE>What a pity...<LINE>
I'm Snorlax.<LINE>No, no. I'm the Planner!<LINE>I don't mean to butt in, but the<LINE>Leftovers item is important, isn't it?
