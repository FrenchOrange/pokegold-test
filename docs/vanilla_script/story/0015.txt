So like I said, I'm Fennel, and as you can<LINE>see, I'm a scientist.<LINE>In fact, the subject I'm researching<LINE>is Trainers!<LINE>Professor Juniper is my friend<LINE>from college.<LINE>She asked me to help you guys.
So!<LINE>I'll give you something to help you.<LINE>This is a Hidden Machine for you!



There are some moves that a Pokémon can<LINE>use even when it is not fighting!<LINE>With this Hidden Machine, you can teach<LINE>your Pokémon a move called Cut.<LINE><LINE>It can cut down a small tree.<LINE>And you can use the Hidden Machine as<LINE>many times as you want, like a TM.<LINE><LINE>Isn't that great?<LINE>But it's difficult to make a Pokémon<LINE>forget a hidden move once it learns it.
And I'd like to ask you a favor, too!<LINE>There is a place called the Dreamyard<LINE>on the outskirts of Striaton City.<LINE>I'd like some of the Dream Mist that a<LINE>Pokémon there called Munna gives off.<LINE>With that, I'll be able to use<LINE>\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000to collect save files of<LINE><LINE>various Trainers!
Fennel: Did Juniper ask you to complete<LINE>the Pokédex?<LINE>It is a challenge to update the Pokédex<LINE>regularly, isn't it?<LINE>Oops! I got distracted! Please bring me<LINE>some of the Dream Mist that Munna<LINE><LINE>gives off in the Dreamyard!
Fennel: Ta-da!<LINE>Thanks to you, I got some Dream Mist,<LINE>and now I can collect save files of<LINE><LINE>various Trainers!<LINE><LINE>Thank you very much!<LINE>As a token of my appreciation,<LINE>I will give you this C-Gear to use!<LINE>The C-Gear is a device related to<LINE>communications, such as<LINE><LINE>Infrared Connection or<LINE><LINE>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
<PLAYER> obtained the \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002C-Gear\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000!
Turn on the C-Gear and<LINE>establish communications?
Yes
No
Some functions of the C-Gear<LINE>will be restricted. Is that OK?
Wireless communications<LINE>are turned OFF.<LINE>Turn wireless communications<LINE>ON in the System Settings.<LINE><LINE>Error code: 50699
You see! The C-Gear was activated, and<LINE>that screen showed up!<LINE>If you touch the “?" icon at the<LINE>bottom-right of the screen, you can read<LINE><LINE>about the C-Gear.
If you want to turn on the C-Gear, touch<LINE>the Power symbol at the bottom right of<LINE><LINE>the screen.<LINE>Then, after turning on the power, if you<LINE>touch the “?" icon at the bottom right<LINE><LINE>of the screen, you can read about<LINE><LINE>the C-Gear.
About \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000...<LINE>I'd like to explain a little more about the<LINE>system to collect Trainers' save files.<LINE>Do you have time to learn more?
I am sorry!<LINE>I am so happy, so I will explain about it!<LINE>Because, thanks to you, we can do a<LINE>great thing!
Now \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000can retrieve memories<LINE>of sleeping Pokémon using Dream Mist!<LINE>That's right! We can collect save files of<LINE>Trainers from all over the world!
What's more, we learned that if you use<LINE>\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000 to make a Pokémon sleep,<LINE><LINE>it will have dreams.<LINE>Then, when you wake up that Pokémon,<LINE>its dream becomes the reality in a<LINE><LINE>space called \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0001Entralink \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000in the middle of<LINE><LINE>the Unova region.<LINE>Isn't Game Sync interesting?<LINE>If you like, please send your save file.<LINE>I've summed up the details in the PC, so<LINE>please check it if you get a chance!
Fennel: \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000 is fascinating, I think.<LINE>Do you think so, too?<LINE>If you get interested, please send your<LINE>save file.<LINE>I've summed up the details in the PC<LINE>at the back.<LINE><LINE>So, please check it, if you'd like!
Fennel: Oh, thank you! <LINE>You also sent your save file. I saw it<LINE>while I was researching Trainers!<LINE>Isn't \xf000\xff00\x0001\x0002Game Sync\xf000\xff00\x0001\x0000 great?
