There are a lot of people in the world,<LINE>and there are just as many different<LINE><LINE>characteristics and ideas.<LINE>I think I'd be really happy if I could<LINE>meet a lot of people and see the<LINE><LINE>differences for myself!
My mama says there's a scary monster<LINE>who comes out of the big hole at night,<LINE><LINE>so we have to stay home and be good!<LINE>But that monster must be a Pokémon.<LINE>Right? So I'm not scared at all!
Along the road ahead, there is a<LINE>coastline that fishing fans love.<LINE>I'm busy, so I won't fish at night, but<LINE>there may be big fish!
My grandma loves to tell old stories,<LINE>and she makes me listen to her long<LINE><LINE>stories all the time.<LINE>Sometimes I just want to go out on my<LINE>own and paint the town red!
Ever since I took a post here, I don't<LINE>really have anything to do.<LINE>I'm so bored! I'm afraid all my policing<LINE>muscles will shrivel up because I don't<LINE><LINE>use them anymore.
My Pokémon always goes out<LINE>to have fun without me.<LINE>I wonder where it gets that attitude?
Gahoon! Gahoon!
My work keeps me very busy, and I only<LINE>go home once a week or so.<LINE>I'm sorry to leave my wife lonely, but<LINE>that's the life of a powerful executive.<LINE>Oh, this is a souvenir from a business<LINE>trip, but she does not seem to need it,<LINE><LINE>so I will give it to you.
I leave on a business trip<LINE>again tomorrow.<LINE>I think of myself as a role model<LINE>for businesspeople.
