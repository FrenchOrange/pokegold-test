Hrmph! So yer the Trainers Elesa was<LINE>talkin' about, huh.<LINE>I'm Clay. I'm the Gym Leader 'round<LINE>these parts.<LINE>Don't be expectin' no welcome, now.<LINE>'Cause when we lowered that bridge,<LINE>the Team Plasma guys we'd caught<LINE><LINE>done escaped in all the ruckus!
Cheren: What a bother.<LINE>We're grateful that you lowered the<LINE>bridge, but how is it our fault that<LINE><LINE>they escaped?
Clay: Ya can say whatever ya want.<LINE>But what's important is y'all showed up,<LINE>and then Team Plasma escaped.<LINE>Maybe it's a little heavy-handed, but<LINE>you oughtta start lookin' for<LINE><LINE>Team Plasma, too.<LINE>Yer both talented Trainers, aren't ya?
Tell ya what…<LINE>If ya find Team Plasma, I'll let ya<LINE>challenge my Gym!<LINE>Life's all about give and take!
Cheren: Well, I suppose that's fair.<LINE>But really, we would have looked<LINE>for Team Plasma even if he hadn't asked.<LINE>I can get stronger while beating that<LINE>bothersome bunch…
<PLAYER>!<LINE>I'll go on ahead.
Ghetsis: Clay.<LINE>It's a pleasure to meet you.<LINE>I am Ghetsis, of Team Plasma.<LINE>I've come to pick up my associates<LINE>who are in your care.
Clay: I don't need no thanks, now.<LINE>Yer buddies were tryin' to steal<LINE>some folks' Pokémon.
Ghetsis: What's this? It seems as if<LINE>there has been some misunderstanding.<LINE>We only free Pokémon from wicked people.
Clay: Well, that sounds real nice,<LINE>if it's true.<LINE>I may not talk purty, but at least<LINE>I'm an honest man.<LINE>You talk real nice, but what yer sayin'<LINE>kinda sounds like lyin'.<LINE>So tell me plain, what are ya tryin'<LINE>to say?
Ghetsis: Team Plasma also has an interest<LINE>in Driftveil City.<LINE>And we have many, many more members<LINE>besides those who are here…
Clay: …Well, I can't tell if yer lyin' or<LINE>not, but I reckon you've won this<LINE><LINE>without a fight.<LINE>Hrrmph. Fine. Take 'em and git!
Ghetsis: A decision worthy of a<LINE>businessman called the Miner King.<LINE>Your grasp of the situation<LINE>is outstanding.<LINE>Well then, we will be taking<LINE>our colleagues off your hands…
Zinzolin: Ghetsis…<LINE>Thank you very much…
Ghetsis: Don't worry, my fellow servant<LINE>of the king…<LINE>We are two of the Seven Sages,<LINE>are we not?<LINE>Well then, everyone, I expect that we<LINE>will meet again somewhere.
Clay: Sorry to let Team Plasma go after<LINE>you tracked 'em down, fellas.<LINE>Say, why don't we cheer ourselves up<LINE>with a Pokémon battle?<LINE>Don't keep me waitin'!
Cheren: Well, we avoided a fight in<LINE>the middle of the city, anyway.<LINE>Still, I can't help but think Ghetsis isn't<LINE>just an ordinary person.<LINE>I'm off to go make my Pokémon stronger.<LINE>I really don't want to lose<LINE>to that Clay guy.<LINE>Actually, I'm going to win my<LINE>Gym Badge in a flawless victory!

Our Gym Leader, Clay, is in the<LINE>middle of something right now.<LINE><LINE>Please come again later.
Bianca: Oh, hi, <PLAYER>!
Bianca: <PLAYER>!!<LINE>Guess what, guess what?
Hey, were you at the Gym just now?<LINE>Oh, hey! That's Driftveil's Gym Badge!<LINE>Oh, that's totally cool. That's amazing.
No, no, no! I can't get distracted being<LINE>all impressed with your shiny new Badge!<LINE>I'm also a Trainer!<LINE>At times like this you battle, right?
Bianca: I haven't had a Pokémon battle<LINE>with you in a while, <PLAYER>.<LINE>You've become totally strong, huh?<LINE>I'm not that strong, so I don't know<LINE>how to say it, but I think you're way<LINE><LINE>tuned in to how your Pokémon feel!<LINE>Oh, you know what! I want to share this<LINE>HM with you, <PLAYER>!
Bianca: My papa gave it to me after<LINE>he tried to take me home that time.<LINE>I'm sure it's so I can come home anytime<LINE>he wants, though…<LINE>Oh, hey, I have to share this with<LINE>Cheren, too…<LINE>See you, <PLAYER>! Buh-bye!
So how about this city's pride and joy,<LINE>the drawbridge?<LINE>We also call it the Charizard Bridge<LINE>due to its elegant form!
Hey there, Trainer!<LINE>Have you ever battled the Elite Four<LINE>of the Pokémon League?<LINE>You can't battle them unless you<LINE>have eight Gym Badges, right?
Oh, ocean…<LINE>I wonder if the tears I've cried<LINE>will flow all the way to Olivine City.
Those Team Plasma meanies forced me<LINE>to battle them.<LINE>And when I lost, they stole my Pokémon!
When I win, it's because of my Pokémon.<LINE>When I lose, it's because of me.<LINE>That's how I always think. If you get<LINE>conceited, you get sloppy fast.
The reason I'm hangin' around is<LINE>because I want to hang around!<LINE>Aww! If my Pokémon just knew the move<LINE>Surf, I could go on top of the water!
Some kids are catching and training<LINE>Pokémon close to the Cold Storage.
The Pokémon of lightning and the Pokémon<LINE>of wind are both known to come and go<LINE><LINE>as they please.
On the other side of the ocean, there<LINE>are a lot of different people and a lot of<LINE><LINE>different Pokémon, aren't there?
The old guy on Route 6 is searching for<LINE>legendary Pokémon.<LINE>If you're interested, go talk to him!
Bridges are amazing. 'Cause they are a<LINE>symbol of connecting the world.<LINE>But the guy on Route 5 is saying the<LINE>same thing, isn't he?
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>I wanted to get the attention of a girl<LINE>I like, so I learned a new style of<LINE><LINE>Pokémon battling.<LINE>Its name… Triple Battle!<LINE>Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is<LINE>really hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three<LINE>Pokémon at a time and battle!<LINE>The rules are simple: just make all of<LINE>your opponent's Pokémon faint.<LINE>And that's a rough explanation<LINE>of Triple Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a<LINE>Triple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!<LINE>I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>I'm always at full throttle.
I hate to burst your bubble when you're<LINE>all fired up, but…<LINE>In Triple Battles, you need three or<LINE>more Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>I have some advice for you.<LINE>Challenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting<LINE>schooled when I was planning to teach.<LINE>Still, you have potential!<LINE>You have to understand your Pokémon<LINE>to win in a Triple Battle.<LINE>If you want more Triple Battles, you<LINE>should go to Opelucid City.
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>Riding a bike and becoming the wind fits<LINE>a bad boy like me.
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>I wanted to get the attention of a girl<LINE>I like, so I learned a new style of<LINE><LINE>Pokémon battling.<LINE>Its name… Rotation Battle!<LINE>Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is<LINE>really hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three<LINE>Pokémon at a time and battle!<LINE>One Pokémon takes the lead position,<LINE>and the other two stand on each side.<LINE>The trick is, each turn you can change<LINE>their positions…<LINE>And that's a rough explanation<LINE>of Rotation Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a<LINE>Rotation Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you!<LINE>I'm a heartbreaker…<LINE>My name… Charles.<LINE>I'm always at full throttle.
