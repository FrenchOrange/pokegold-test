Hello, Trainer!<LINE>You've found a memo already, and you're<LINE>looking for a book about Pokémon?<LINE>Tee hee! In fact, I am also reading a<LINE>book about Pokémon. It's about Tepig.<LINE>I wonder if the first Pokémon you met<LINE>in this Gym was Tepig?

Tee hee! What a pity!<LINE>This book about Tepig says:<LINE>“It gives off flame from its nostrils.<LINE>When it's not well, it can give off<LINE><LINE>only smoke."<LINE>That's slightly different from “it gives<LINE>off smoke from its head while it runs."<LINE>...The answer to this memo may not be<LINE>a living thing. Tee hee!
Wow! Great! That's correct!<LINE>The book that I am reading says:<LINE>“It gives off flame from its nostrils.<LINE>When it's not well, it can give off<LINE><LINE>only smoke."<LINE>It's slightly different from “it gives off<LINE>smoke from its head while it runs."<LINE>...The answer to this memo may not be<LINE>a living thing.

Have you already found the third memo?<LINE>Pretty good!<LINE>...So, what does the memo say?<LINE>“If you heat it up in a pot,<LINE>it'll be delicious. What is this?"<LINE>The book I am reading is about Tepig...<LINE>But you don't think this book<LINE>about Tepig is the answer, do you?!
Oh, I know you're just kidding!<LINE>...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen<LINE>sweets made by heating up Berries.<LINE>Now, what were they called?
Of course you don't!<LINE>...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen<LINE>sweets made by heating up Berries.<LINE>Now, what were they called?

Tee hee! That is correct!<LINE>Well, here we go, Trainer!
Hmmmmm...<LINE>What a pity!<LINE>I will tell you the answer<LINE>if you win against me!

Oh!<LINE>That is correct!<LINE>“Flame burns inside its body, and it gives<LINE>off smoke from its head while it runs."<LINE>That's exactly how a locomotive looks!<LINE>Well, I'll let you read this book.<LINE>But, before that...<LINE>It would be great for my research<LINE>if we had a Pokémon battle.
