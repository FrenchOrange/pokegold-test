Seems like I've met you somewhere...<LINE>Anyway, don't get too wound up and fall.<LINE>When guests get hurt, it causes me<LINE>no end of trouble.<LINE>...'Kay, you can pass.
Oh! So you're a Trainer, then!<LINE>I see. You're far from family<LINE>and traveling the world, huh?<LINE>I suppose it's fine if you contact them<LINE>once in a while.<LINE>'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you.<LINE>Hmm... You like trading, do you now?<LINE>Well, that's all right, isn't it.<LINE>You're active--just like a young person<LINE><LINE>should be.<LINE>'Kay, you can pass.

Hey, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0003.<LINE>You've managed to trade with folks in<LINE>even more places, huh?<LINE>That's really something!<LINE>I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting<LINE><LINE>pretty full, then?<LINE>Wow, you're amazing!<LINE>'Kay, pass on through.

Why, if it isn't \xf000Ā\x0001\x0003.<LINE>I'll just do a brief security check.<LINE>...W-what's this? Ooh, it's a kind of gum<LINE>I've never seen! Is it a new brand?<LINE><LINE>Maybe I'll buy some later.<LINE>'Kay, you can pass.
Why, if it isn't \xf000Ā\x0001\x0003.<LINE>Just a little more, and you'll have<LINE>traded with every place here, huh?<LINE>It's really reassuring to me that kids<LINE>like you are going to be the ones running<LINE><LINE>the world!<LINE><LINE>Just a little more to go.
