???: What's this?
What an uncanny resemblance...<LINE>It's surprising to meet another Trainer<LINE>who has intense eyes like that<LINE><LINE>Pokémon Trainer.<LINE>What's your name?<LINE>...<LINE>OK. I'll remember that!<LINE><PLAYER>, nice to meet you.<LINE>I'm Cynthia.<LINE>I'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you.<LINE>I have an insatiable curiosity for<LINE>researching Pokémon myths.
I'm sure you know about Undella Town's<LINE>Abyssal Ruins, right?<LINE>I'm staying here at my friend's villa<LINE>so I can investigate them.
In order to get to know each other<LINE>better as Pokémon Trainers,<LINE><LINE>I would like our Pokémon to have a match.<LINE>Would you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon,<LINE>my heart always begins to race...<LINE>Interesting...<LINE>My Pokémon in their Poké Balls are<LINE><LINE>radiating a happy feeling.<LINE>Are you the reason?<LINE>What are you?
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly<LINE>and rationally, am I right?<LINE>When you're ready, come and talk to me.<LINE>I'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh.<LINE>You've had a chance to get ready?<LINE>I do want our Pokémon to have a match...<LINE>Are you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation!<LINE>What an exceptional battle!<LINE>You certainly bear a resemblance<LINE>to that Trainer who faced Giratina...<LINE>Oh, pardon me.<LINE>I was just thinking out loud.<LINE>I love being here in spring and summer.<LINE>I can't stay all year, because there's<LINE>so much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well.<LINE>You're a great Trainer, and it would make<LINE>me happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I love to come here in<LINE>spring and summer.<LINE>But there are a lot of things to<LINE>investigate in Sinnoh, as well.<LINE>I'd be delighted to see you again.<LINE>You're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again!<LINE>I've got to tell you...<LINE>My Pokémon are excited to battle yours.<LINE>Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun!<LINE>No holds barred!
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity.<LINE>Summers in Undella Town make me feel like<LINE>I'm on holiday. I forget about battling!<LINE>But in spring, I feel like getting<LINE>worked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are<LINE>excited about battling your Pokémon...<LINE>Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For some reason, this reminds me<LINE>of a time when I told a Trainer like you<LINE><LINE>to go see many, many more places<LINE><LINE>and to meet many more Pokémon.<LINE>For me, it has really been worthwhile to<LINE>come all the way to far Unova.<LINE>Why? Because...<LINE>I met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the<LINE>fullest, people and Pokémon need<LINE><LINE>the chance to throw themselves into<LINE><LINE>battle against the fiercest opposition.<LINE>That's why I want to battle you.<LINE>How about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle,<LINE>I'll learn more about you<LINE><LINE>and how you've taken care of them.
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed.<LINE>I know you can battle on bigger<LINE>stages than you've done so far!<LINE>It's so plain to me that your light can<LINE>shine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared?<LINE>Let's battle at full strength and see<LINE>how bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle<LINE>them to learn about the kind of people<LINE><LINE>they are. Observe the Pokémon they<LINE><LINE>choose, which moves they taught them,<LINE><LINE>and which items the Pokémon hold.<LINE>You don't need words at such times...<LINE>If you want to know more about me...<LINE>Come to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: Having everything go your way<LINE>is the road to disillusionment.<LINE>Knowing the difference between what's<LINE>impossible and what's possible...<LINE>I used to know someone who <LINE>talked about that a lot.
Caitlin: No matter how hard I try,<LINE>I cannot defeat Cynthia.<LINE>Before, I would have exploded with rage.<LINE>Now, I have the tranquility to reflect on<LINE>my performance to see how I can improve.
Caitlin: Tell me something.<LINE>Are you familiar with Battle Castles?<LINE>You can find them in Johto and Sinnoh,<LINE>so challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa.<LINE>I have villas all over the world,<LINE>and I allow Cynthia to use them.<LINE>You are welcome to come and play<LINE>whenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all<LINE>is better than having psychic powers<LINE><LINE>you can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels,<LINE>if I don't have enough input,<LINE><LINE>my output suffers.<LINE>It's the same thing for Trainers.<LINE>To grow stronger, Trainers need to have<LINE>countless battles and learn many things.<LINE>Then, they must put what they've learned<LINE>to the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing...<LINE>Silver Wing...<LINE><LINE>They stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World...<LINE>and the single Pokémon found there...<LINE><LINE>What an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research<LINE>I do, I still have no clue.<LINE>How old do you think Cynthia is?<LINE>Any idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a<LINE>certain Pokémon in mind.<LINE>Do you get it?<LINE>Using your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming<LINE>stronger than you are now?<LINE>My answer is simply loving Pokémon<LINE>with all your heart.<LINE>That's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: Once every few years,<LINE>the Champions of each region gather<LINE><LINE>and compete to see who is the strongest!<LINE>An interesting idea, don't you agree?
Cynthia: I'd love to live here...<LINE>But if I did, there would be a mountain<LINE>of research materials piled up...<LINE>Am I right? Cynthia, enough for now!<LINE>Next time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem.<LINE>I have a white swimsuit and<LINE>a black swimsuit...<LINE><LINE>Which one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult.<LINE>I was greedy and brought<LINE>a lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick<LINE><LINE>which one to wear.
Iris: Oh, hey!<LINE>Did you see Cynthia's Garchomp?<LINE>It's too cute!
Iris: Soon, Drayden and I are going<LINE>to ride the cruise ship!<LINE>Castelia City is wall-to-wall people,<LINE>but if I'm with him, I'll be OK!
Iris: Sometimes I think about the village<LINE>where I was born, but I'm totally OK!<LINE>Because I met lots of Pokémon--<LINE>and all of you!
Iris: Look! Look! It's the ocean!
Iris: The ocean is so pretty. I love it!<LINE>So I stayed underwater a long time.<LINE><LINE>I made everyone worry!
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but<LINE>Pokémon battles are a different story!<LINE>If you're not super prepared,<LINE>your battles with Electric types<LINE><LINE>will leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after<LINE>safely passing through a rain cloud<LINE><LINE>in a violent rainstorm...<LINE>Someday, I'd like to share<LINE>that moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that.<LINE>When it comes to swimsuits...<LINE>You're either about self-composure<LINE>or you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop,<LINE>skip, and a jump if I use my cargo plane.<LINE>But... I also love to travel the sky<LINE>with a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm...<LINE>Swimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people<LINE>to draw out a Pokémon's charm<LINE><LINE>if they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City?<LINE>You know it runs on energy generated<LINE>by Electric-type Pokémon?<LINE>...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries<LINE>is bad for your body and spirit.<LINE>That's when you must short out your<LINE>logic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word...<LINE>Without even a whisper...<LINE>My Pokémon connect me to other Trainers,<LINE>transmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly, <LINE>swimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
Lenora: Aren't Fossils amazing?<LINE>Although they are not alive and<LINE>cannot speak, they tell us so much<LINE><LINE>about the era in which they lived.<LINE>Hee, hee.<LINE>It was Professor Juniper who said that.
Lenora: TMs can be used as many times<LINE>as you wish, to be sure.<LINE>If you teach Retaliate to many different<LINE>Pokémon, eventually you should find<LINE><LINE>the perfect Pokémon for it!
Lenora: When I was a little girl,<LINE>my dad, who was a miner, would<LINE><LINE>always bring back bones for me.<LINE>My young heart was captured by bones!<LINE>Before I knew it, I was a researcher.
Lenora: Recently, a girl named Bianca<LINE>came to ask me about Pokémon.<LINE>A Trainer's curiosity is insatiable<LINE>at any stage.
Lenora: Cynthia is a famous archeologist.<LINE>In the course of our research, we have<LINE>shared many academic conversations.
