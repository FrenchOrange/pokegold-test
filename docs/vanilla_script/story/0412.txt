I decided to find a new Pokémon partner<LINE>around Route 13.
Marvelous Bridge is really mind boggling!<LINE>So I am taking a rest!
Did you know? Before Marvelous Bridge<LINE>was built, there was a girl who always<LINE><LINE>played with Abra around here.<LINE>She was so full of energy...
What do people buy from the<LINE>vending machine?<LINE>To keep checking on that...<LINE>This is my life.
Hey, you!<LINE>Don't you want to try a Triple Battle?
Triple Battles are battles with<LINE>three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon ready<LINE>for battle!
You are a Trainer, yet you are not<LINE>prepared to battle?
They say chance favors<LINE>the prepared mind.
I want to research an effective<LINE>fighting method for Rotation Battles.<LINE>Would you have a battle with me?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle<LINE>that uses three Pokémon.<LINE>Please prepare at least three Pokémon<LINE>for battle!
If you're a Trainer, you should be<LINE>more aggressive.
Now you can have Rotation Battles with<LINE>your friends!
