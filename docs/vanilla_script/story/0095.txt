Professor Juniper: Hello, <PLAYER>!
Cheren: Come here.
Professor Juniper: Elesa called and was<LINE>asking me all about Electric-type<LINE><LINE>POKéMON, and I thought about you guys.<LINE>That's why I wanted to see you.<LINE>Ta-da! Freebies for you!
Here, Cheren!
You, too, <PLAYER>.
If you see a POKéMON that<LINE>you want to have join you,<LINE><LINE>be sure to use a good type of POKé BALL.<LINE>Because this could be the<LINE>first and last time you see that POKéMON!
I know it might seem strange for me<LINE>to say this, since I'm the one who asked<LINE><LINE>you to complete the POKéDEX, but please,<LINE><LINE>remember to enjoy your journey!
Of course, I'm not saying you can just<LINE>neglect the POKéDEX. But you know that!<LINE>Now, if you'll please excuse me,<LINE>I have to go meet Bianca.
Cheren: It seems the Professor<LINE>gave us the POKéDEX as a reason<LINE><LINE>to send us on a journey.<LINE>At least, that's what my mom told me.<LINE>They wanted us to go out and see the<LINE>world, so my mom, Bianca's mom, and your<LINE><LINE>mom made a request to Professor Juniper.
<PLAYER>, what should we do now?<LINE>I think I'd like to show the professor my<LINE>thanks by going to Route 4 and catching<LINE><LINE>some POKéMON I haven't yet caught.
If you've come from Route 4,<LINE>Nimbasa City is ahead.<LINE>Next! If you've come from Nimbasa City,<LINE>Route 4 is ahead!
Look at the electric bulletin board to<LINE>see what's happening in Nimbasa City!
