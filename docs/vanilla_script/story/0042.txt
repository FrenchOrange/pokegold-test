Hi! Would you like to go to Unity Tower?
People are quite different,<LINE>depending on where they live.<LINE>It's a bit surprising that rules and ways<LINE>of thinking are different just because<LINE><LINE>the places we live are different!
One person will be on board!<LINE>Please get on board!
Unity Tower is a place where Trainers<LINE>gather from all over the world!<LINE>If you have friends who live far away,<LINE>you may be able to have a merry reunion!
Please come again!
Yes
No
What is it?
Both Pokémon and people will meet their<LINE>destined partner someday!<LINE>I believe it because my sister who got<LINE>married said so!
I've come to Castelia City to have a<LINE>dance lesson!
What do you want?<LINE>Oh! The dance team! You're going to<LINE>introduce me to the team!<LINE>Oh! Then, before that, let's have a<LINE>Pokémon battle!
I was great in Pokémon lessons!
If you want me to join your dance team,<LINE>you've got to be strong!
What was that?<LINE>Oh! The dance team!<LINE>I will join the team!
