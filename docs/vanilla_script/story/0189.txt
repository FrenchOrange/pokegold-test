Ryoku: I was planning to catch the<LINE>Pokémon called Volcarona that lives<LINE><LINE>in this Relic Castle and present it<LINE><LINE>to Ghetsis.<LINE>But the Shadow Triad said that Ghetsis<LINE>has gone somewhere, right?
The Seven Sages...<LINE>We always said we were complete when the<LINE>seven of us were together.<LINE>Now I don't know the meaning of those<LINE>words anymore.<LINE>I guess I don't mind, even if we were<LINE>being used, but the dream is over.
I no longer need this.<LINE>Ghetsis gave it to me, but I have no use<LINE>for it.
Ryoku: This Relic Castle and our own<LINE>castle are both crumbling...<LINE>But what's different is that this Relic<LINE>Castle is the remains of a civilization.<LINE>And our castle left nothing behind...
Looker: Regarding Team Plasma...<LINE>I am an officer of the International<LINE>Police, and you must satisfy my request<LINE><LINE>for certain information!
Ryoku: Understood.<LINE>But we don't know much about Ghetsis or<LINE>our lord N!<LINE>We haven't even figured out if they are<LINE>father and son...
Looker: Accept my thanks!<LINE>Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding,<LINE>there yet remains but \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the<LINE><LINE>Seven Sages still at large.<LINE>They are thinking--upon what topics?<LINE>They are hoping--upon what chances?<LINE>This is of the utmost urgency.<LINE>At once! On the way!
Looker: I thank you profoundly!<LINE>Curiously, <PLAYER>...<LINE>There is a topic on which we must speak.<LINE>A report has reached my ears of someone<LINE>far from here. Indeed, this someone has<LINE><LINE>spotted a person like N and a...<LINE><LINE>dragon Pokémon.<LINE>I depart to validate the validity<LINE>of this information.<LINE><LINE>We shall meet again, so until then, adieu.
