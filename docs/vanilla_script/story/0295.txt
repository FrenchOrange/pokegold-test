Skreeree...
This Pokémon has become attached to me.<LINE>But as far as I'm concerned, a Pokémon<LINE>is just a simple tool.<LINE>I don't understand...
Will you go to the Pokémon League?
Go!
I see.
I don't need an item to catch<LINE>Pokémon anymore...
Poké Balls...<LINE>From my point of view, they are items<LINE>that keep Pokémon confined.<LINE>But for Trainers like you, they are a way<LINE>to bond with Pokémon...<LINE>If you run out of Poké Balls,<LINE>come see me. I will give one to you.
You need a Poké Ball?<LINE>OK. Take this.
