Please show me a Pokémon that's<LINE>\xf000ă\x0001\x0000 type!
Oh! You have that type!<LINE>I'm inspired!<LINE>Thank you! As a token of my gratitude,<LINE>which one would you like?

One \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000!<LINE>It's all yours now!

The Pokémon you chose is not the one<LINE>I requested.<LINE>What I want to paint is a Pokémon that's<LINE>\xf000ă\x0001\x0000 type!
Oh!<LINE>The shape of this Egg...<LINE>Superb! It gives me chills!<LINE>It's electrifying! It makes me tremble!<LINE>Alas, even I cannot tell what type<LINE>an Egg is!
