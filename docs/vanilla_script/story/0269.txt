Sometimes, above the bridge, you can<LINE>see the shadows of bird Pokémon, right?<LINE>Their feathers drift to the ground here!<LINE>And when you try to pick them up,<LINE>occasionally, you'll run into a Pokémon.
When a ship passes, the bridge raises<LINE>and lowers.<LINE>But Clay controls when the ships run<LINE>from the start, so when the bridge<LINE><LINE>raises and lowers is up to Clay.
When Driftveil is mentioned, what comes<LINE>to mind is the Cold Storage…<LINE><LINE>and Charles!
