PROFESSOR JUNIPER: This is a<LINE>POKéMON CENTER!<LINE>Don't you feel better as soon as you<LINE>step through the door?<LINE>OK, let's start your tour!
BIANCA: Ooh, wait for me!
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: A POKéMON CENTER is a<LINE>truly incredible place!<LINE>Do you know why?<LINE>Because your POKéMON can be healed!<LINE><LINE>And, what's more, it's absolutely free!<LINE>A POKéMON CENTER is a Trainer's<LINE>best friend!<LINE>Here, <PLAYER>, give it a try.
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Where are you off to?<LINE>Humor me and talk to the lady at the<LINE>counter. Let her take your POKéMON.
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: You should be talking<LINE>to the lady at the counter, not to me…
BIANCA: All you need to do is give her<LINE>your POKéMON, <PLAYER>.
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: OK. Now that your<LINE>POKéMON have rested, I'll show you how<LINE><LINE>to use the PC at a POKéMON CENTER.
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: This is the PC.<LINE>It's free for any Trainer to use.<LINE>You can store POKéMON in your PC Boxes<LINE>or select POKéMON stored in your<LINE><LINE>PC Boxes to take along with you.<LINE>In addition, if you catch a new POKéMON<LINE>while you have six POKéMON traveling<LINE><LINE>with you, the POKéMON you just caught is<LINE><LINE>sent automatically to the PC network!<LINE>Surprising, isn't it? Amazing, even.<LINE>Here's something else that's cool.<LINE>If you select my PC, I'll evaluate the<LINE>progress you've made on your POKéDEX!
BIANCA: PROFESSOR…<LINE>It says “Someone's PC"<LINE>on the screen. Who is Someone?
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: Very good, BIANCA.<LINE>That's a great observation!<LINE>Good question, and I'd like to say more,<LINE>but for now, just ignore that and<LINE><LINE>go ahead and use the PC.<LINE>“Someone" is the person who made the<LINE>POKéMON Storage System.<LINE>…Someone I'm sure you'll meet someday!<LINE>OK, let's move on!
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: Now, this is the<LINE>Poké Mart.<LINE>This is the place to buy useful items and<LINE>sell the ones you don't need anymore!<LINE>That gentleman over there will<LINE>help you with a smile!
PROFESSOR JUNIPER: So, let's<LINE>wrap this up.<LINE>I've given you the basics of being<LINE>a Trainer!<LINE>I'm going to head back to NUVEMA TOWN.<LINE>One final thing…<LINE>When you get to STRIATON CITY, go and<LINE>meet an inventor named Fennel.<LINE>She's a friend of mine from long ago, and<LINE>I'm sure she'll help you on your way!<LINE>Best of luck! I hope that your journeys<LINE>prove to be the adventure of a lifetime!
BIANCA: Ooh! What should I buy?<LINE>Potions and POKé BALLS are definitely<LINE>important. Ummm…thinking…
