Do you want to go back to Castelia City?
We are just about to leave, so please<LINE>get on board and wait a moment.
Just come talk to me when you want<LINE>to return to Castelia City!
That Team Plasma...<LINE>They sure do terrible things!
The smell of the ocean is so soothing!
Waaah! I'm scared!
You sure took care of<LINE>those bad guys, mister!
You sure took care of<LINE>those bad guys, miss!
Making my grandchild cry!<LINE>If they are underestimating me because<LINE>I'm old... Grrr!
Thank you very much for<LINE>saving my grandchild.
Shut your trap!<LINE>If you stay here quietly,<LINE>we won't be rough.
What do they hope to accomplish<LINE>by occupying the island?<LINE><LINE>What a sketchy group!
If I had known this island's secret<LINE>earlier, I would've...<LINE>What? No! Nothing!<LINE>Just talking to myself!
What are they doing in this little<LINE>memorial park? There's nothing here<LINE><LINE>but an old lighthouse...
Too many people use Pokémon<LINE>for bad deeds!
This officer's Pokémon couldn't stand up<LINE>to them!<LINE><LINE>That blasted Team Plasma!
I'm really glad a strong Trainer<LINE>like you is around!
Recently, I've been bored because<LINE>the number of tourists has decreased.
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich<LINE>family bought this island and named it<LINE><LINE>Liberty Garden.<LINE>It's a place where people and Pokémon<LINE>could live freely.
Dock 2<LINE>To board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light<LINE>of freedom.<LINE>Only authorized personnel may enter.
My fellow officers rushed here by<LINE>police boat!<LINE>Thanks to them, we rounded up<LINE>these baddies!
How's that Pokémon doing?<LINE>The island sure has been quiet since<LINE>that incident.
Team Plasma forever!
We won't give up!
You're irredeemable!
Get moving!
Professor Juniper: Thanks to you,<LINE><PLAYER>, this group that was<LINE><LINE>up to no good has been captured!
Victini is a mythical Pokémon that is said<LINE>to radiate energy from its body...<LINE>When Pokémon or people come into contact<LINE>with that energy, it fills up their bodies,<LINE><LINE>and they exhibit more power than usual.<LINE>That's why there was no end to the<LINE>people who wanted to use Victini for<LINE><LINE>their own evil ends...<LINE>I'm sure the rich person who built this<LINE>underground room for Victini was<LINE><LINE>sincerely trying to help it.<LINE>But I think shutting the poor thing up in<LINE>this room was a mistake.<LINE>Thanks to you, Victini has a new destiny<LINE>that does not involve being used in<LINE><LINE>Team Plasma's schemes.<LINE>Making sure no one misuses Victini's<LINE>powers is now your duty!
Also...<LINE>In the Unova Pokédex, Victini was<LINE>assigned a special number: zero.<LINE>I've heard the special number was<LINE>assigned in the hope that Victini's power<LINE><LINE>to bring victory would be shared with the<LINE><LINE>Trainer who travels with this Pokédex...
Professor Juniper!<LINE>We cornered the crooks with our<LINE>high-speed police boat!<LINE>We will return to Castelia City!<LINE>Please come on board, too!
Professor Juniper: Thank you!<LINE>I'll be right there!
I can't believe it when people are led<LINE>astray by Pokémon's astounding abilities<LINE><LINE>and try to misuse them...<LINE>But it's only when we face Pokémon with a<LINE>good heart that we can make a<LINE><LINE>brighter future!
