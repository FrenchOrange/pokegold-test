Burgh: That way!<LINE>M'hm. There, heading toward the Gym?!


When work's finally over…<LINE>When my thrown POKé BALL rocks three<LINE>times and I hear that great “click"…<LINE>My life is full of things that give me joy!
I'm a battling Clerk ⑭!<LINE>…But my POKéMON are weak.
Busy, busy!<LINE>After I eat breakfast, I have to think<LINE>about lunch.<LINE>After eating lunch, I worry about dinner.<LINE>Every day's the same. What a busy life!
Hey there, Trainer!<LINE>Are your POKéMON healthy?<LINE>Being healthy's the best, because when<LINE>you're healthy, you can do anything!
…Grumble, grumble, grumble.<LINE>Should I change my POKéMON's moves,<LINE>or should I change my POKéMON?<LINE>Grumble, grumble…
Castelia City has so many people!<LINE>Sometimes there are people who are only<LINE>interested in themselves.
My favorite way to spend my lunch break<LINE>is watching ships at the dock.
Working women are beautiful, and<LINE>battling POKéMON are wonderful!
At the Battle Company, we welcome<LINE>Trainers who are proud of their skills.
Next time, I'll do it! Next time, I want to<LINE>eat a Casteliacone for sure!
