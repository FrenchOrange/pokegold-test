LACUNOSA TOWN<LINE>Methodical and Orderly
Welcome to LACUNOSA TOWN.<LINE>In this town, people live as methodically<LINE>as clockwork from morning to night.<LINE>If you live your life soaking up sunlight,<LINE>you can sleep very well at night.
Well, hello there, young traveler!<LINE>Would you like to hear an old story<LINE>of LACUNOSA TOWN?<LINE>Bear with me, because I'm an old lady who<LINE>likes telling tales the old-fashioned way!
There's a great big hole at the back<LINE>of this town.<LINE>A long time ago, a huge meteor fell from<LINE>the sky and made the big hole.<LINE>A very scary monster was hiding<LINE>inside the meteor!<LINE>People say the monster appeared in the<LINE>village at night, bringing a cold wind, and<LINE><LINE>it stole away people and POKéMON…<LINE>So the villagers built big walls to keep<LINE>the monster out and made a rule that<LINE><LINE>no one could go out after dark.
…Of course, nowadays nobody believes in<LINE>such things.<LINE>But you know…<LINE>Even now, the people of this town<LINE>stay inside after dark.<LINE><LINE>Isn't that strange?<LINE>I guess old stories and old traditions<LINE>have some influence on our current life.
Oh, well, that's too bad. Come talk to me<LINE>if you're ever in the mood for a story!
At night, a scary monster comes out of<LINE>the big hole, so you have to go home<LINE><LINE>and be good!
Along the road ahead, there is a<LINE>coastline that fishing fans love.<LINE>Whirrrrr…plunk!<LINE>That's the sound my fishing rod makes.<LINE>I like to hear it every day!
My grandma loves to tell old stories.<LINE>She makes me listen to her long stories<LINE>all the time!
There are a lot of people in the world,<LINE>and there are just as many different<LINE><LINE>characteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since<LINE>I took a post here.<LINE>Since nobody goes outside at night,<LINE>it's very peaceful.
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My POKéMON always goes out<LINE>for fun without me.
