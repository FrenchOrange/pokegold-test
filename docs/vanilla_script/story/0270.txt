…<LINE>…Come.
…<LINE>GHETSIS. We brought the one you wanted.
GHETSIS: Excellent. It seems that<LINE>you have obtained the Dark Stone.<LINE>I congratulate you on a job well done.
GHETSIS: Excellent. It seems that<LINE>you have obtained the Light Stone.<LINE>I congratulate you on a job well done.
It is my lord N's thought that the two<LINE>holders of the legendary POKéMON<LINE><LINE>should put their beliefs on the line<LINE><LINE>and strive to find which is the true hero.
This is not necessary, however.<LINE>From his infancy, I provided him with the<LINE>education required to become the hero<LINE><LINE>of legend. Indeed, he has been so<LINE><LINE>acknowledged by the legendary POKéMON.<LINE>…Such purity of purpose is his.
The liberation of POKéMON of which I… Of<LINE>which TEAM PLASMA speaks is the<LINE><LINE>separation of POKéMON from<LINE><LINE>foolish people!<LINE>That's the truth! All Trainers will become<LINE>helpless to resist us!<LINE>We alone will be able to use POKéMON!
The preparations are complete!<LINE>When my perfect plan is set in motion,<LINE>first a few gullible POKéMON Trainers who<LINE><LINE>are unable to resist TEAM PLASMA will<LINE><LINE>release their POKéMON.<LINE>Then that number will become a hundred,<LINE>then a thousand…<LINE>In no time, even the GYM LEADERs and the<LINE>Champion will become unable to fight us.<LINE>Having a POKéMON will be considered<LINE>a bad thing!<LINE>Even people like the sad little BIANCA,<LINE>whose POKéMON was stolen in CASTELIA,<LINE><LINE>will be unable to face public opinion<LINE><LINE>and will release their POKéMON!<LINE>That's the kind of world we'll make!
You may have the Stone, but there's no<LINE>chance whatsoever that the legendary<LINE><LINE>POKéMON will accept you as the hero.<LINE>So, if you're not willing to hand over<LINE>your precious POKéMON, I suggest you<LINE><LINE>search for some courage--<LINE><LINE>because you're going to need it!
When I was running around trying<LINE>to outrun the trains,<LINE><LINE>I got overheated. Phew!<LINE>Anyway, please take this!
This TM contains Flame Charge!<LINE>If the move lands, the user's Speed<LINE><LINE>goes up! You'll blow by everyone!
Hey, you!<LINE>It's just my opinion, but it's best if you<LINE>avoid this area on weekend evenings.<LINE>The brats who live around here<LINE>often get up to something stupid.
