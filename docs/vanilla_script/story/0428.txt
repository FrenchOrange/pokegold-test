Cheren: <PLAYER>! <LINE>I understand the feeling.<LINE>I want to go somewhere with<LINE><LINE>my Pokémon too, but first<LINE><LINE>we have to go thank Professor Juniper.<LINE>Come on. The lab is this way!
Cheren: I'm sorry, but could you<LINE>go to Bianca's house?<LINE>I'll bet she's spacing out<LINE>like she usually does.<LINE><LINE>She's totally flighty.
Bianca: ...That's a secret, OK?
Cheren: OK!<LINE>Let's go meet the professor.
Bianca: Heeey!<LINE><PLAYER>, wait up!
Bianca: Come on!<LINE><PLAYER>, wait up!
Mom: Oh, there you are! And...?<LINE>What did the professor have to say?<LINE>She asked you to complete the Pokédex?!<LINE>I can't believe it!
Well, actually, I can.<LINE>I already knew she was going to ask.
That's why I brought you three of<LINE>these Town Maps. Take them with you!
Mom: Here you are, Cheren.
Cheren: I'll take good care of it.
Mom: And one for you, too, Bianca.
Bianca: Th-thank you so much!
Mom: As for your room, <PLAYER>--<LINE>or what's left of it...<LINE>No need for any of you to worry.<LINE>I'll take care of tidying up.<LINE>OK, <PLAYER>?
Mom: Ah, Pokémon. They are so cute,<LINE>but they have enough power to destroy<LINE><LINE>a bedroom! They are really something.<LINE>With Pokémon like that at your side,<LINE>you'll be safe wherever you go!
I'll let your parents know!<LINE>I hope that, in addition to Pokémon,<LINE>you'll find lots and lots of places<LINE><LINE>you like in the Unova region--<LINE><LINE>and become wonderful adults!<LINE>Have a great trip!
Cheren: If I use the Town Map,<LINE>I'll always know where I am...<LINE><LINE>That's certainly helpful.<LINE>Shall we head to Route 1?<LINE>The professor's waiting.
Bianca: Let's go, let's go!<LINE><PLAYER>, hurry and come too, OK?
Bianca: <PLAYER>...<LINE>It's this way!
Cheren: Bianca says if we're starting a<LINE>journey together, she wants us all to<LINE><LINE>take our first step at the same time.
Bianca: Hey, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Let's all take our first step<LINE>on Route 1 together!
Cheren: OK, here we go!

One, two!
The power of science is amazing!<LINE>Now you can use infrared to do all<LINE>sorts of things in the blink of an eye!
Do you think traveling with Pokémon<LINE>changes people?
Me too! Traveling and thinking about many<LINE>things can definitely make a difference.
You're right! It's fine to just enjoy the<LINE>journey without overthinking it!
I've heard there are a lot of Pokémon<LINE>and many different people in the world.<LINE>When I hear stories about them,<LINE>I get very excited!
Bianca: Oh! I wonder what will happen!<LINE>Isn't this so exciting?!
Cheren: It sure is!<LINE>C'mon, the professor's waiting.
Nuvema Town<LINE>The Start of Something Big!
<PLAYER>'s House
Cheren's House
Bianca's House
Juniper Pokémon Lab
Cheren: Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Is Looker through talking to you?
Bianca: ...I'm sorry.<LINE>By the time I went to get the<LINE>Striaton City Gym Leaders,<LINE><LINE>everything was over...
Cheren: If that's the case...<LINE>I let Ghetsis escape when the<LINE>Shadow Triad created an opening.
Bianca: ...Ghetsis?<LINE>The Shadow Triad?
Cheren: I'll tell you later about what<LINE>happened in the castle.<LINE>It's more important to ask what you plan<LINE>to do now, Bianca.
Bianca: You know what? You know what!<LINE>I'm gonna go to White Forest!
Bianca: You know what? You know what!<LINE>I'm gonna go to Black City!
Cheren: That's the city on the other side<LINE>of Route 16 when you leave from<LINE><LINE>Nimbasa City. Hmm.<LINE>If you go that way, you might be able to<LINE>meet all sorts of Pokémon<LINE><LINE>you've never seen before.
Cedric: Oh!<LINE>Well, this is nice timing!<LINE><LINE>I see you're all here!
Just a moment ago, I got some National<LINE>Pokédex data from an acquaintance.<LINE>Since you're here, let's upgrade your<LINE>Pokédex with the National Pokédex data.<LINE>I'm sure you'll be visiting a wider range<LINE>of places. Naturally, that means<LINE><LINE>you'll be encountering more Pokémon.<LINE>Let me see your Pokédex for a sec!
There you go, Bianca!
Next up is Cheren!
And last, but not least...
<PLAYER>'s Pokédex was upgraded<LINE>with the National Mode!
Cedric: You can now switch your<LINE>Pokédexes to the National Mode Pokédex.<LINE>Completing the National Pokédex will<LINE>surely be a big challenge.<LINE>So, take your time, enjoy yourselves,<LINE>and meet lots of Pokémon.
Bianca: Wow, the National Pokédex...<LINE>It looks like there are tons of Pokémon<LINE>I don't know yet! <LINE>Oh! Ooh! I want to show Mom and Dad<LINE>my Pokédex! I gotta go!<LINE>Let's meet again somewhere, OK?!
Cheren: Huh. Bianca's as impetuous as<LINE>ever, no matter what is going on.
I think I'll travel all the way around<LINE>Unova, starting at Route 1 again.<LINE>I'm sure I'll discover lots of new things.<LINE>Could be I'll encounter the Seven Sages<LINE>along the way...<LINE>And, <PLAYER>, if we spy each other<LINE>along the way, let's battle again, OK?
