I may walk fast, but I live a slow and<LINE>relaxing life.
I'm going home early today to have<LINE>Pokémon battles with my sisters.
Hello!<LINE>Greeting is important, isn't it?
They say time is money. But when you<LINE>spend time, you can't get it back.
There are always so many people here...
Even when I loaf, I do it all-out.<LINE>I am always serious!
This city is a sleepless city...<LINE>But I need my beauty sleep.
I wish there were shoes<LINE>that recharge energy by walking!
My big customer must be waiting...
I just keep walking...today, tomorrow,<LINE>and the day after tomorrow.
Good luck! Me!<LINE>Good luck! You!
I will watch a baseball game<LINE>this weekend.
I am having a battle called a job!<LINE>This is quite tough. That's why it's fun!
Hmmm... It may be a good idea<LINE>to Dress Up your Pokémon.
Have you had a Pokémon battle<LINE>with the Gym Leader, Burgh?<LINE>He's a strange one, but he likes Pokémon<LINE>very much.
I haven't traveled with my Pokémon<LINE>for a long time. I feel like doing that...
I will go to the Kanto region<LINE>for business.
People from different countries<LINE>gather here in Castelia City.
Everyone is a professional walker!
Even in the crowd of people,<LINE>don't lose sight of yourself!
Every day, everybody goes their own way.
My business card has a picture of<LINE>the Pokémon I like best.
I always walk here, so<LINE>I am good at dodging people.
Argh! You distracted me! I was trying<LINE>to count all the pedestrians!
Hey, hey, kid!<LINE>It's dangerous!
Will you become a motorbike rider<LINE>when you grow up?
The night wind is piercing right through<LINE>me... My motorbike is freezing, too...
Zowieee!
Wooooo!
Is that so?
Yes.
Huh?
Oh, no!
What's up?
Sorry.
Bye-bye!
Nah.
Eep!
I see!
How is it?
Hello!

Ouch...

Hungry...
