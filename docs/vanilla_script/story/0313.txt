Hey, le Trainer fantastique! Want to be<LINE>part of the experiment of the century?<LINE>You need two DS systems to play with<LINE>Poké Transfer!<LINE>Do you have a second DS system that you<LINE>can use?
If you decide that you want to play with<LINE>Poké Transfer sometime, you're welcome<LINE><LINE>to come back and ask me.
I'm sorry! Sumimasen! But you don't have<LINE>enough space in your PC Box.<LINE>Please make room for six Pokémon and<LINE>try again.
OK! But just remember! ¡Muy importante!<LINE>Once you bring a Pokémon here, you can't<LINE>send it back. Do you still want to do it?
DS Wireless Communications will<LINE>be launched.

OK, OK. Come here. Stand right there!
Well, let's begin! Allons-y!
Great! Molto bene!
You're just as skillful as I expected!<LINE>Poké Transfer is working!<LINE>But hey, <PLAYER>, you can't fool me!<LINE>I bet you can do even better than this.<LINE>A Trainer of your caliber can make<LINE>really good use of Poké Transfer!
Wunderbar! Magnifique! Brilliant!<LINE>Your skill is impressive!<LINE>This is the very reason why we scientists<LINE>are doing research!<LINE>But, <PLAYER>! I think a Trainer with<LINE>your experience can make use of it<LINE><LINE>even more elegantly.<LINE>Please master your genius handling of<LINE>Poké Transfer, and show us how<LINE><LINE>it's done!

I put the Pokémon you caught<LINE>in your PC Box.
But, it seems you could not<LINE>catch any Pokémon.
Ugh...<LINE>There seems to be a communication error.<LINE>I'm afraid you have to try it again!
Hi, hello!<LINE>You came here.<LINE>That means you are a visitor?<LINE>Huh? No?<LINE>You came all the way here?<LINE>Ah, you are a Trainer?<LINE>Are you in the middle of your journey?<LINE>Ah, this is your Trainer Card?
W-w-what? You!<LINE>You have all the Gym Badges?!
Great!<LINE>You may be able to...
Professor Paaaaaark!
Quick, quick!
Oh, there you are!
Professor!<LINE>Do you have a minute?<LINE>I think you do. Listen!<LINE>This kid is a Trainer who has all the<LINE>Gym Badges. All of them!<LINE>I am sure this Trainer can operate it!
I have told you many times.<LINE>This invention is great indeed, but<LINE>without a professional Trainer...
What? You have the Gym Badges?<LINE>ALL of them?!
Fantastic!<LINE>Fantastico!
Yahoooooooooooooooo!
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable!<LINE>Hi, I am Professor Andrew Park!<LINE>You!<LINE>Er...
<PLAYER>!
<PLAYER>! Are you willing to<LINE>participate in an ambitious experiment<LINE><LINE>that will make history?<LINE>This device is called Poké Transfer.<LINE>It connects...blah blah blah...<LINE>...called DS system...meanwhile...<LINE>...blah blah...of molecules...and then...<LINE>...while evoking...blah blah...<LINE>...ergo, energy particles will...<LINE>...blah blah...and if the frequency...<LINE>...as you see...with faraway Pokémon...<LINE>...the Alpha waves...blah blah...<LINE>...following which...reach convergence...<LINE>...blah blah...spectacular results!
To put it more simply, if you use this<LINE>device, you may be able to bring Pokémon<LINE><LINE>here from other regions.<LINE>But just for safety's sake, the Pokémon<LINE>you're transferring shouldn't be holding<LINE><LINE>anything! So make sure to take their<LINE><LINE>items first.
...So! You!
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer!<LINE>Will you participate in the great<LINE>experiment of the century?<LINE>You need two DS systems to use<LINE>Poké Transfer!<LINE>We will conduct the experiment with<LINE>another DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when<LINE>you transfer them. It's safer that way.<LINE>In rare cases, there are Pokémon that<LINE>cannot be transferred, but<LINE><LINE>Professor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to<LINE>have an impact on people in the future...<LINE><LINE>people living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer.<LINE>We're keeping a careful eye to make sure<LINE>all the Pokémon have safe travels!
