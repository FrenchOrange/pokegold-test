CHEREN: Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I just challenged the GYM LEADER BURGH.
He's a seasoned GYM LEADER.<LINE>He made me work for that GYM BADGE!<LINE>But for me, Bug-type POKéMON<LINE>aren't much of a challenge.
I'm going to keep winning like this against<LINE>all of the UNOVA region's GYM LEADERs!<LINE>Then, I'll head for the POKéMON LEAGUE<LINE>and outperform the Champion!<LINE>If I do that, everyone will admit<LINE>what a strong Trainer I am…<LINE>That will make me feel truly alive…
BURGH: Ah hah!<LINE>You're the one who fought<LINE>TEAM PLASMA in PINWHEEL FOREST…<LINE>If I remember, your name is…<LINE><PLAYER>!<LINE>Come to challenge the GYM, I suppose?
BURGH: Ah hah!<LINE>You're the one who fought<LINE>TEAM PLASMA in PINWHEEL FOREST…<LINE>If I remember, your name is…<LINE><PLAYER>!<LINE>Come to challenge the GYM, I suppose?
Aww. Sorry, but could you wait a bit?<LINE>I was informed that TEAM PLASMA<LINE>has shown up!<LINE>In fact… Come with me!<LINE>I'm going to the dock at Prime Pier!
BURGH: This is definitely the place.
TEAM PLASMA: No one's here! Not a soul!<LINE>No other TEAM PLASMA members, nor any<LINE>of the Seven Sages, are inside.<LINE>…If you think I'm lying, why don't<LINE>we have a little battle and find out?
TEAM PLASMA: Don't scare me like that.<LINE>Come on!
TEAM PLASMA: I…had a thought!<LINE>I'll take care of this weak-looking runt,<LINE>so you can show off by handling<LINE><LINE>that tough-looking guy over there!
Think about how a POKéMON feels when<LINE>it's being used by a pathetic Trainer!
What's your problem with<LINE>taking people's POKéMON?!
BURGH: Oh, please!<LINE><PLAYER>, I'll leave that one to you!
BURGH: Oh, please!<LINE><PLAYER>, I'll leave that one to you!
BURGH: Looks like our only<LINE>option is to battle them and go on in.
TEAM PLASMA: This is bad…<LINE>Badbadbadbadbadbadbad!<LINE>Bad for TEAM PLASMA!<LINE>Or Plasbad, for short!<LINE>It's in my best interest to go<LINE>report to the Seven Sages right now!
IRIS: Phew, we got lost.<LINE>Even with directions from the<LINE>XCASTER, I couldn't figure it out!
BURGH: TEAM PLASMA is inside.<LINE>The stolen POKéMON may be in<LINE>there as well.<LINE><LINE>OK, I'm going in!
IRIS: OK! This time, I'll join the fight!<LINE>Come on, BIANCA. You, too!
BIANCA: W-wait!<LINE><PLAYER>! You come, too!
The XCASTER is ringing.
<PLAYER> picked up the XCASTER.
What GYM LEADERs test is the strength<LINE>of the bond between the challenger<LINE><LINE>and his or her POKéMON!
Before challenging the GYM, you'll want<LINE>to be sure you have enough Potions.
Being a POKéMON Trainer doesn't<LINE>necessarily make someone stronger.<LINE>But everyone can love their POKéMON<LINE>and enjoy playing together.
I have six POKé BALLS in my BAG!<LINE>But, really, what I want is<LINE>Great Balls and Ultra Balls!<LINE>You can't buy them at the Poké Mart<LINE>until you've collected BADGES, though.
My POKéMON is soooo cute!<LINE>It always makes me feel better<LINE>when I come home!
