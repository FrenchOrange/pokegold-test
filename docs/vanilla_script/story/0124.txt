Ahem!<LINE>I am the chairman who loves Pokémon the<LINE>most among Pokéfans in the entire world!
If you are a Trainer, will you show me<LINE>how you are raising your Pokémon<LINE><LINE>with loving care?
Oh, I understand!<LINE>You are a shy Trainer!
Oh!<LINE>Which Pokémon will you show me?

...Hmmm.<LINE>It's hard to tell...
Well...it's a bit hard to tell how much<LINE>that Egg has grown.
Oh! This <PLAYER> was level \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0001<LINE>when you met, but now it's level \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0002!
You've raised it very well.<LINE>It's received a lot of love from you.
You've raised it quite well.<LINE>I feel your love for this Pokémon.
You've raised it well.<LINE>You must be affectionate.
I see! Although it's just a smidgen,<LINE>I can feel your love for your Pokémon.
That is a token of gratitude for showing<LINE>me your great love for your Pokémon!
Well, you showed me good stuff!<LINE>Please keep raising your Pokémon<LINE>with loving care!
What? It has not grown at all.<LINE>Still, if you travel with your Pokémon<LINE>from now on, I am sure it will grow!
Welcome to the Pokémon Fan Club.<LINE>Shall I check how friendly your Pokémon<LINE>is toward you?

I can't tell whether or not you and<LINE>the Egg are close friends.
Oh, my. Your <PLAYER>...
It is super friendly to you!<LINE>I'm a bit jealous!
It is quite friendly to you!<LINE>You must be a kind person!
It is friendly to you.<LINE>It must be happy with you.
It is a little friendly to you...<LINE>That's what I'm getting.
The relationship is neither good<LINE>nor bad... It looks neutral.
Hmmm...<LINE>It may not like you very much.
By any chance, you...<LINE>Are you a very strict person?<LINE>I feel that it really doesn't like you...
Oh, you are so shy! Come on,<LINE>don't hide your Pokémon from me.
Muuun!
Glibalugga!
