Kawbraa!
The Pokémon climbed up the rock wall and<LINE>disappeared somewhere into the cave...
The Pokémon climbed up the rock wall and<LINE>disappeared somewhere into the cave...
The strength you exhibited communicating<LINE>with your Pokémon also got through<LINE><LINE>to Cobalion.<LINE>If you and your Pokémon train together<LINE>and get even stronger, it will probably<LINE><LINE>return to this place.
It seems that thanks to you, Cobalion<LINE>has sensed a change in the world.<LINE>It's a world where people and Pokémon<LINE>help each other and live together.<LINE>I believe Cobalion wants to remain<LINE>with you and travel by your side.
The fact that you battled Cobalion and<LINE>you related to each other should be<LINE><LINE>easily communicated to Terrakion and<LINE><LINE>Virizion because of the close bond<LINE><LINE>between the three.<LINE>I'm sure they will also give you a chance<LINE>to prove your worth.
The obstacles that separated Terrakion<LINE>and Virizion from people are probably<LINE><LINE>gone now.<LINE>Whether you want to search<LINE>for those two is up to you,<LINE><LINE>but they are definitely waiting for you...
I saw your skill. It's impressive for one<LINE>so young.<LINE>Maybe you're the one...<LINE>Hmmm... It may be possible...<LINE>How about it? Will you listen to<LINE>an old man's story?
In the distant past, when Pokémon and<LINE>people lived in different worlds,<LINE><LINE>a war between people started<LINE><LINE>an intense fire in a forest where<LINE><LINE>many Pokémon lived.<LINE>The Pokémon were surrounded by smoke<LINE>and flames. They were in big trouble.<LINE>And then, the legends Cobalion,<LINE>Terrakion, and Virizion appeared!<LINE>Terrakion used its amazing strength to<LINE>destroy rocks blocking the<LINE><LINE>escape route.<LINE>Virizion used its quick movements<LINE>to protect Pokémon from looming flames.<LINE>And Cobalion led the frightened<LINE>Pokémon out of the burning woods.
The people who started the war were<LINE>routed by the power of the legends.<LINE>Because of Cobalion, Terrakion, and<LINE>Virizion, the war was ended.
When people fight, there's no peace for<LINE>Pokémon, either.<LINE>The three legends learned that<LINE>the deeds of humans could lead<LINE><LINE>to dire consequences for their world.
They cut themselves off from people<LINE>and disappeared.<LINE>No one saw much of them after that, and<LINE>the three faded into myth...
I've been searching for them for<LINE>decades, and I finally figured out that<LINE><LINE>one of them was deep in this cave.<LINE>But the legendary three do not<LINE>trust people.<LINE>If people approach, they bare their<LINE>fangs and attack.
It can't be helped, because they only<LINE>know the old world...<LINE>They still don't know the world has<LINE>become a place where people and Pokémon<LINE><LINE>try to understand and help each other.
You seem like you might be able to show<LINE>them that people and Pokémon can trust<LINE><LINE>each other and live together.<LINE>If they take another look at people,<LINE>I think they will stop hiding from us...
It's not just about bonds between<LINE>people and Pokémon.<LINE>Having all living things appreciate and<LINE>trust each other would be best.
If you don't listen to what your elders<LINE>have to say, I can't expect much<LINE><LINE>from you!<LINE>You shouldn't have come to this place!<LINE>Leave now!
