If you wreck Great Landorus's little<LINE>shrine, it'll cause a bad bad storm!
That's not true!<LINE>The POKéMON that brings bad<LINE>thunderstorms is a different POKéMON!
That's not true!<LINE>The POKéMON that brings bad windstorms<LINE>is a different POKéMON!
No, silly, you've got it wrong!
This is a shrine for Great Landorus. It<LINE>punished a POKéMON that did a bad thing!<LINE>If you wreck the shrine, it can't punish<LINE>that stormy POKéMON if it comes back!
But that doesn't make any sense!<LINE>If a POKéMON does a bad thing,<LINE>Great Landorus will come to help us,<LINE><LINE>whether it has a shrine or not!<LINE>You're the silly one!
No, YOU'RE silly! Hey, wait!
This little shrine is dedicated to a<LINE>POKéMON called Landorus.<LINE>They say that when Tornadus and<LINE>Thundurus were whipping up storms that<LINE><LINE>damaged houses and fields all over the<LINE><LINE>UNOVA region, Landorus made them stop.
That's a story from way long ago, when<LINE>my grandpa was a little boy.
So if Tornadus and Thundurus come here<LINE>again, Great Landorus may come back.
That's what my grandpa told me!
It's a small, weathered shrine.
It's a small, weathered shrine.
Tornadus and Thundurus are struggling<LINE>inside their POKé BALLS!
Karamukukuk!
Landorus flew far away into the sky…
