Thanks again for your help.<LINE>My bug Pokémon are scurrying with<LINE>excitement about getting to battle you.<LINE>Let's get straight to it!
Aww...<LINE>I lost.<LINE>Whatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me<LINE>because you are a-MAZ-ingly strong!<LINE>This is the Gym Badge!<LINE>You beat me, so it's yours!
<PLAYER> received the<LINE>Insect Badge from Burgh.
It's the Insect Badge!<LINE>It's insectible--I mean, incredible!<LINE>If you have three Badges,<LINE>Pokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey you,<LINE><LINE>including traded Pokémon.<LINE>Because I'm a generous guy,<LINE>I'll also give you this.
Struggle Bug also lowers the<LINE>Sp. Atk of the target that was damaged.<LINE>I'm the best guy to tell you,<LINE>it's the little things that count!
How many discoveries have you made<LINE>since you started your adventure?<LINE>When I was a kid, my innocent heart was<LINE>captured by the beauty of bug Pokémon.<LINE>I drew with them and battled with them,<LINE>and after all this time, I continue<LINE><LINE>to discover new things.<LINE>A world shared with Pokémon is a world<LINE>swarming with mysteries.
Burgh: Heya!<LINE>This is what I do.<LINE>I keep raising Pokémon and drawing<LINE>pictures inspired by the Pokémon I raise.<LINE>It's what I love to do. My life hums<LINE>with energy. What could be better?
When you step on the switch,<LINE>the one that pops out is--moi!<LINE>On that note, have a battle with moi!
Hiding makes battle instincts dull,<LINE>you know.
Now. Come. On.<LINE>Step on this switch, and what happens?<LINE>Moi!
Yeeeeeeeeah! Thank you for going<LINE>to the trouble of calling me out!<LINE>I'll channel my gratitude into my<LINE>Pokémon's moves and...<LINE><LINE>make sure it gets to you!
If you hadn't stepped on that switch,<LINE>I'd still be stuck hidden away.<LINE>That's right! Bug Gym Trainers like to<LINE>be bugged!
Hiding beneath the floor, I understand<LINE>how a Bug-type Pokémon feels.
What do you think of Castelia City?<LINE>I bet, with all of the bustling people,<LINE>you started feeling worn down on your<LINE><LINE>way to the Gym!<LINE>Never mind! This will help. Take it!
The theme of this Gym is<LINE>walking through walls.<LINE>At first glance, these funny honey walls<LINE>may look impassable or even impossible.<LINE><LINE>If you try hard, it'll work out. So I say.<LINE>But...if it doesn't, here's a sweet tip:<LINE>step on the switches on the floor!
Wow! That's amazing!<LINE>You swatted aside our Gym Leader<LINE>Burgh's tricky attacks...<LINE>I can barely imagine how much<LINE>stronger you're going to get!
The Gym Leader said he was going to<LINE>Prime Pier and left for a little bit.<LINE>You're welcome to go track him down.
