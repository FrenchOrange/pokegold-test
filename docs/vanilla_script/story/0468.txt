Ho! Hoo!<LINE>Welcome to White Forest!<LINE>In White Forest, people live<LINE>in harmony with nature and with Pokémon.<LINE>Please listen to the voice of the forest.<LINE>It's saying “Bienvenue!"<LINE>Ho! Hoo! Hoo!
I do research into the Pokémon<LINE>that live in this forest.<LINE>In theory, you should find <PLAYER><LINE>living in this forest.
Hoo!<LINE>That's <PLAYER>!<LINE>So it lives in this forest, too!
What's more, you caught it today!<LINE>Ho hoo!<LINE>This means there are <PLAYER><LINE>in White Forest.<LINE>For you, my skilled Pokémon catcher--<LINE>this small trifle. Hoo!
If you return here tomorrow, I'm sure<LINE>the forest will say “Bienvenue" again!
Thank you very much for today.<LINE>See you again tomorrow!<LINE>The forest is murmuring, “À très vite!"
I'm researching the Pokémon<LINE>that live in this forest. Hoo!<LINE>But there haven't been any Pokémon<LINE>recently, and the forest is forlorn.
If you see <PLAYER> in this forest,<LINE>please let me know.<LINE>That will be proof that Pokémon<LINE>are living in this forest.
But--that <PLAYER> wasn't caught<LINE>today, was it? Hoo!<LINE>What I want to know is whether<LINE><PLAYER> is still living in the forest.<LINE>The forest itself wants to know, too!
Did you notice the sky's beauty today?<LINE>Tomorrow will be fine, too!
Let's go Berry picking together!
I need Berries for tomorrow's dinner,<LINE>so go pick some, OK?
Let's have a Triple Battle with the<LINE>Pokémon I have worked so hard to raise!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle<LINE>in which you use three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon together<LINE>to use in battle!
Oh... I wanted to see<LINE>the Pokémon you've raised.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
I have always lived with these Pokémon.<LINE>Hmm. How would you like to try a<LINE>Triple Battle with me?
In order to have a Triple Battle,<LINE>you need to have at least three<LINE><LINE>Pokémon able to battle.
Oh...<LINE>I hope I'll get to see them another time!
There are so many things to consider,<LINE>but that is part of the fun of<LINE><LINE>Triple Battles!
