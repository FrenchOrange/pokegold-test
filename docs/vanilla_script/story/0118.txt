I can tell you're paying a lot of<LINE>attention to training <POKEMON>.<LINE><LINE>Careful not to be too strict!
The POKéDEX is important, but time spent<LINE>having fun together is also important.<LINE>Say, I just had a thought--<LINE>have you heard of DRAGONSPIRAL TOWER?
Really?<LINE>Quite impressive.
Eh… I'm not surprised you haven't<LINE>heard of it.
OK. Give this story a listen.<LINE>DRAGONSPIRAL TOWER is said to be<LINE>the Unova region's oldest building.<LINE>Stories say it's the place where<LINE>legendary POKéMON came to life or<LINE><LINE>where they remain in deep slumber.

CHEREN: <PLAYER>, I've been talking<LINE>with BIANCA, and I'm wondering…<LINE>Since we left NUVEMA TOWN, has<LINE>something about me…changed?<LINE>Thinking about what I want to do…<LINE>Thinking about what I should do…<LINE>It felt like there was nothing…<LINE>Have I really become stronger?<LINE>Or is it just my POKéMON that have?<LINE>I don't know anymore!
BIANCA: Hey, hey. Cheer up, CHEREN…<LINE>Isn't it nice to see everyone?!<LINE><PLAYER>! Know what? This time,<LINE>I'll go to the POKéMON Fan Club.<LINE>I'm really searching…<LINE>for what I want to do and what I can do!

It is there that our lord N<LINE>waits for you.<LINE>…Now, our mission is complete.
