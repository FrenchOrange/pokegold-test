Cedric: Hello, <PLAYER>!<LINE>How is <POKEMON>?
Ah! This <POKEMON> has really taken<LINE>a shine to you.
I can tell you're paying a lot of<LINE>attention to training <POKEMON>.<LINE><LINE>Careful not to be too strict!
The Pokédex is important, but time spent<LINE>having fun together is also important.<LINE>Say, I just had a thought--<LINE>have you heard of Dragonspiral Tower?
Really?<LINE>Quite impressive.
Eh... I'm not surprised you haven't<LINE>heard of it.
OK. Give this story a listen.<LINE>Dragonspiral Tower is said to be<LINE>the Unova region's oldest building.<LINE>Stories say it's the place where<LINE>legendary Pokémon came to life or<LINE><LINE>where they remain in deep slumber.

I know it's just past Icirrus City,<LINE>but that's all I know about it.<LINE>That's all anyone knows,<LINE>because no one has ever been inside.
My daughter has wanted to investigate<LINE>that tower for a long time.<LINE>“What! There's something I don't know?!"<LINE>That kind of feeling is pure adventure.<LINE>And I'm not too old for some adventuring.<LINE>Away I go to have a look at<LINE><LINE>Dragonspiral Tower!<LINE><LINE>Catch you later!
Cheren: <PLAYER>, I've been talking<LINE>with Bianca, and I'm wondering...<LINE>Since we left Nuvema Town, has<LINE>something about me...changed?<LINE>Thinking about what I want to do...<LINE>Thinking about what I should do...<LINE>It felt like there was nothing...<LINE>Have I really become stronger?<LINE>Or is it just my Pokémon that have?<LINE>I don't know anymore!
Bianca: Hey, hey. Cheer up, Cheren...<LINE>Isn't it nice to see everyone?!<LINE><PLAYER>! Know what? This time,<LINE>I'll go to the Pokémon Fan Club.<LINE>I'm really searching...<LINE>for what I want to do and what I can do!
Brycen: Who are you?
Bianca: Who? Us?<LINE>I'm Bianca, and this is Cheren...
Brycen: I know you are there!<LINE>Why don't you show yourselves?
... <LINE>Impressive, Gym Leader of Icirrus City.<LINE>We, the Shadow Triad, are beings of the<LINE>shadows...and not easily noticed.
Our mission was to speak only<LINE>with <PLAYER>, but so be it.<LINE>Ghetsis has a message for you:<LINE>come to Dragonspiral Tower.
It is there that our lord N<LINE>waits for you.<LINE>...Now, our mission is complete.
Brycen: Dragonspiral Tower?!<LINE>What's going on?<LINE>Hey! Tell me...
Brycen: Now, hang on.<LINE>Young man, if you're here for<LINE>a Gym challenge, hang on for a bit.<LINE>I've got to head to Dragonspiral Tower!
Cheren: I'm going, too.<LINE>Dragonspiral Tower is to the north<LINE>of here, right?
Bianca: Whoooooa! Whoa.<LINE>Wh-what should I do?<LINE>F-for now, I have to go to<LINE>Dragonspiral Tower...<LINE><LINE>OK! I'm heading north!
Bianca: Whoa, whoa, whoa!<LINE>Wh-what should I do?<LINE>F-for now, I have to go to<LINE>Dragonspiral Tower...<LINE><LINE>OK! I'm heading north!
