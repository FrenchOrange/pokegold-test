It feels so peaceful here. I love it!
When you're surrounded by trees,<LINE>you feel like your entire being<LINE><LINE>has become one with nature.
City life seems like it would be<LINE>really nerve racking…
Fresh air!<LINE>A comfortable breeze.<LINE><LINE>Mmmm… This place has everything.
No surprises, no stress--<LINE>that is the secret of a good life!
POKéMON are the same! They prefer to<LINE>live in a natural setting, too.
Here, everyone is pleasant and kind<LINE>to everyone else.<LINE>I want to work with everyone<LINE>for the sake of this incredible forest!
The force of nature commands<LINE>our respect.<LINE>The force of nature is what supports<LINE>all life. Nature's bounty brings us<LINE><LINE>so much goodness.<LINE>Nature's power surpasses imitation!
Leo: Hello there! Ah… Doesn't it feel<LINE>terrific to enjoy the beauties of nature?<LINE>I'm Leo. I come from the Black City<LINE><PLAYER> visited.<LINE>Nice to meet you!
Leo: Hello there!<LINE>Today, I woke up to the pleasant rustling<LINE>of leaves in the wind.<LINE><LINE>This place is so relaxing!
Recently, I've been feeling a certain…<LINE>Hm, I don't know…<LINE><LINE>…Maybe I'm craving the city lights.
Guess what?<LINE>Check this out!<LINE>A Pidgey was eating food<LINE>in the grass right over there!
Silvia: Why, hello!<LINE>Isn't this place sublime?<LINE>The air is so fresh. It's all so tranquil.<LINE>I'm Silvia. I'm from the Black City<LINE><PLAYER> visited.<LINE><LINE>It's a pleasure to meet you!
Silvia: Even if I take off my glasses,<LINE>I'll know exactly where I am.<LINE>What tells me is the lush greenery<LINE>all around.
You know, the time I spend here is lovely,<LINE>but something's missing…<LINE>That's how I feel.
If my triple-strength glasses don't lie,<LINE>I met a little Wurmple-kins in a spot<LINE><LINE>just ahead of here!<LINE>This is a special place… So serene!
Dave: 'Sup! Call me Dave!<LINE>I used to mix it up a lot with<LINE><PLAYER> in Black City!<LINE>Nice meetin' ya!<LINE>I feel like this place is bold enough to<LINE>take in a tough guy like me!
Dave: 'Sup!<LINE>I've got it goin' on today!<LINE>Listen up! I'm gonna spread the word<LINE>about all the awesome things about<LINE><LINE>nature! With a fierceness!
What can I say?<LINE>White Forest is too dull.<LINE>It doesn't have enough hustle and bustle<LINE>to keep a guy like me interested.
Aaaaaaaeeeeeeeek!<LINE>Is that a Gastly over there?<LINE>Oh, whew. It's just your shadow.<LINE>But I have seen a Gastly recently.
Britney: I'm <PLAYER>'s friend Britney.<LINE>I'm used to living on the edge<LINE>in Black City!
Britney: We're up to our ears in nature<LINE>here. It sure winds you down.<LINE>Couldn't be more different from<LINE>the freewheelin' life in Black City!
Hmm.<LINE>Now that I've started to think about it,<LINE>I miss being wild and free in Black City.
Are you searching for Hoppip?<LINE>No problem! I saw one!<LINE><LINE>Run through the tall grass and catch it!
Robbie: I'm Robbie from Black City,<LINE>where <PLAYER> passed through!<LINE><LINE>Nice to meet you!<LINE>You know what? I'd never imagined<LINE>a place like this really existed.<LINE>It's nothing but green as far as<LINE>the eye can see! I'm shocked!
Robbie: I was in Black City because I'm<LINE>fascinated by architecture, but being<LINE><LINE>in a forest is pretty nice, too!
Ohhhhhhh, am I bored! So bored!<LINE>I want to go back to Black City!
Oh! You'll never guess!<LINE>Elekid! I saw an Elekid<LINE>running off that way!<LINE>Maybe I should chase it!
Miki: Hello!<LINE>My name's Miki! Nice to meet you!<LINE>I battled <PLAYER> in Black City!<LINE>Super tough!
Miki: Ahhh, mmm… This place is soothing.<LINE>I read somewhere that the scent of<LINE><LINE>trees and grass makes you feel calm,<LINE><LINE>in an aromatherapy kind of way.<LINE><LINE>This place seems to have the same effect!
Gosh. Maybe I've become too calm…<LINE>'Cause I'm bored now!<LINE>But that's worth feeling, too,<LINE>from time to time.
Wait, what?<LINE>A Togepi just ran behind you right now!
Ryder: Take a deep breath!<LINE>The air here is so pure and wonderful!<LINE>I'm Ryder. I'm from the Black City, where<LINE><PLAYER> visited. Good to meet you.
Ryder: Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!<LINE>When the air is this fresh,<LINE>it gives you extra power for training!<LINE>But it is a bit of a problem not to have<LINE>a sparring partner!
Hyah… Hyah? Hyah?<LINE>I've been having trouble lately<LINE>getting into my training…<LINE>Maybe Black City suits me better…<LINE>
When I was practicing forehand strikes<LINE>with my POKéMON, a Machop was watching<LINE><LINE>us in envy. Why don't you go look for it?
Karenna: I got here from Black City<LINE>as fast as I could!<LINE>I'm impressed by how <PLAYER> fights,<LINE>and I know I still have a long way to go!
Karenna: Keep going! Yeah!<LINE>My POKéMON and I are running!
Phew… I'm tired of running!<LINE>Time for another battle!<LINE>For that, back to Black City!
Oh. Are you going to run with me?<LINE>I just saw a wild Slakoth.<LINE>If we go running, maybe you'll meet it.
Doug: Hello, hello! I'm Doug!!<LINE>I came from Black City.<LINE><LINE>I'm an acquaintance of <PLAYER>.<LINE>Now, there's someone who has furious<LINE>POKéMON battles!
Doug: When I'm surrounded<LINE>by nature, I work!<LINE><LINE>It's coming along pretty well!
So, I've had a lot of fresh air,<LINE>and I think I'm well refreshed!<LINE>I have a lot of other work to do,<LINE>so I want to go to Black City.
Recently, I saw a Shinx in this area!<LINE>Yes, just being here refreshes me!
Vincent: Hey, how are you?<LINE>In Black City, I was <PLAYER>'s<LINE>sparring partner.<LINE>Not too bad of a Trainer, I'd say,<LINE>but not as strong as I am.
Vincent: The vastness of nature<LINE>spices up my life!<LINE>Yeah, I really have taken a liking to<LINE>this place.
Well, you know, I was born and raised in<LINE>the city, so maybe I should go home soon.
Recently a Magby was staring at me from<LINE>over there!<LINE>It ran as soon as our gazes met.<LINE>If it likes me, it should let me know!
Marie: The oxygen is so rich!<LINE>Just like <PLAYER> said!<LINE>In a place like this, I'm sure I can focus<LINE>and write my paper!
Marie: Fresh air and a good paper…<LINE>Once I write it, I'll present it in<LINE><LINE>Black City!
I'm good and refreshed, so I<LINE>want to go back to Black City.
A few seconds ago, when I was doing some<LINE>deep-breathing exercises, I saw a<LINE><LINE>Magnemite imitating me! It made me laugh.
Lena: <PLAYER>…?<LINE>Sorry. You look like someone I know…<LINE>A person I met in Black City and had a<LINE>POKéMON battle with…
Lena: The plants grow thick and green<LINE>with the blessing of the soil.<LINE><LINE>I want to be thankful for this as I walk.
People are drawn to man-made things.<LINE>I miss Black City…
It's so peaceful here. I love listening to<LINE>the Grass-type POKéMON breathing and<LINE><LINE>the bird POKéMON chirping…<LINE>Did you notice? A Ralts just ran past<LINE>right behind you.
Carlos: Oh! Hello!<LINE>There is so much to see here!<LINE>I just came from Black City, where I met<LINE>a Trainer named <PLAYER><LINE><LINE>who was very strong. It was fun!
Carlos: Oh! Hello!<LINE>I've traveled in many places, but places<LINE>this close to nature are very rare!
But, hmmm… I think it's about time<LINE>to head somewhere else.
Starly!<LINE>Starly was just there!<LINE>Why don't you go look for it?
Molly: So this is White Forest!<LINE>It's very different from Black City!<LINE>Hey, do you know a Trainer named<LINE><PLAYER> who is really strong?
Molly: I've been traveling, and I've seen<LINE>a lot of places, but I have never seen<LINE><LINE>a place this pretty before!
This is a pretty place, but maybe<LINE>a little boring…
Oh, that's right! An Azurill was running<LINE>happily toward the grass!<LINE>Maybe I should run with the POKéMON<LINE>in the grass!
Frederic: <PLAYER>?!<LINE>…Oh! My mistake!<LINE>I'm very frustrated at losing our<LINE>POKéMON battle, so I want a rematch<LINE><LINE>the next time I see that Trainer.
Frederic: Oh… Have a look at this!<LINE>My POKéMON is so happy!<LINE>POKéMON love nature, but…<LINE>I'm the complete opposite!
Well, my POKéMON is having fun, but<LINE>I'm starving for some excitement.
Just a second ago, my POKéMON was<LINE>playing with a wild Budew.<LINE>It ran away when it saw me, but<LINE>it really looked like it was having fun!
Lynette: How are you?<LINE>I was in Black City, and I got to battle<LINE><PLAYER>, who was really strong!<LINE>It was wonderful.
Lynette: This environment with<LINE>nothing but nature is nice, too.<LINE><LINE>It's soothing.
But I'm a little tired of being out in<LINE>the countryside.<LINE>I want to spend time in a place where<LINE>there is more stuff.
I saw an Oddish today!<LINE>I haven't really seen one before,<LINE>so I was fascinated!
Pierce: Until recently, I was in<LINE>Black City. I also battled with<LINE><LINE><PLAYER> there.<LINE>I suspect <PLAYER> likes White<LINE>Forest more than you might suspect.
Pierce: Living simply among<LINE>nature and enjoying your own life…<LINE>I think that is not a bad way to live.
Hmmm…<LINE>But I might be getting tired of<LINE>the slow life…
Today, I saw a Mareep!<LINE>That's something you could<LINE>only see in White Forest!
Gene: Nature is great! But I remember<LINE>Black City sometimes.<LINE>My battle with <PLAYER> is an<LINE>important memory!
Gene: My hobby is meeting POKéMON<LINE>in their natural habitat!
But recently, I've been thinking I want<LINE>to test the strength of the POKéMON<LINE><LINE>I've met.
I met an Aron today! It was really lucky!<LINE>White Forest definitely fits me<LINE>like a glove!
Piper: The natural surroundings here are<LINE>very comfortable.<LINE>Until recently, I was in Black City, and<LINE><PLAYER>'s battling style was<LINE><LINE>fairly efficient.
Piper: Leisurely time passed together<LINE>with POKéMON…<LINE><LINE>Things like that are important.
But recently, for some reason, leisurely<LINE>passing time like this makes me feel<LINE><LINE>a little impatient.
I spent today with a Bellsprout!<LINE>It was a precious experience!
Miho: POKéMON in White Forest<LINE>are so adorable!<LINE>But <PLAYER>, who I met in<LINE>Black City, was pretty cute too!
Miho: POKéMON and this expansive nature!<LINE>Everyone is in their natural state,<LINE>and I think it's wonderful!
But I might need a little more<LINE>than just nature.<LINE><LINE>I have to find more things I want to do!
In nature, Seedot and people can<LINE>become friends…<LINE><LINE>That sure is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Shane: Everyone is very honest<LINE>in White Forest.<LINE>I wonder if <PLAYER>, who I just met<LINE>in Black City, will like White Forest more<LINE><LINE>than you might expect.
Shane: Here both POKéMON and<LINE>people can just be themselves.
But I'm worried about how this<LINE>more honest me will be seen.
I just saw a Rhyhorn over there!<LINE>A Rhyhorn in its natural state… Wow!
Ralph: In White Forest, it's fun how<LINE>people and POKéMON can deal with<LINE><LINE>one another directly.<LINE>Before, in Black City, I battled<LINE><PLAYER>, and we were able to show<LINE><LINE>each other how we felt!<LINE>That was fun, too!
Ralph: I want POKéMON and people to be<LINE>able to face each other directly and<LINE><LINE>understand one another.
But I also think I want to promptly<LINE>be able to show people how I feel!
I met a Lotad over there today!<LINE>We communicated our feelings to each<LINE>other, and I'm still awed by the memory.
Eliza: A lifestyle where you encounter<LINE>nature is fulfilling.<LINE>But when I had a POKéMON battle with<LINE><PLAYER> in Black City, something<LINE><LINE>about that made me feel fulfilled, too.
Eliza: When you encounter nature,<LINE>your heart becomes that much richer.
But…<LINE>Just looking at nature doesn't fulfill<LINE>your spirit.<LINE>That's what I've been thinking recently.
I saw a Trapinch, and it made<LINE>my heart happy.
Collin: My success story begins here!<LINE>In Black City, I had a rival named<LINE><PLAYER>, but I don't have one here!<LINE>I'm going to make a fortune!
Collin: I like how everyone here looks<LINE>so happy!<LINE>I want to make them even happier with<LINE>my business!
Business opportunities don't just come<LINE>rolling at you so easily.<LINE>Ahh… I feel like Black City may be a<LINE>better fit for me…
Successful people are always looking up!<LINE>So I was looking up while I was walking,<LINE>and I accidentally walked into an Abra.<LINE><LINE>Sorry, Abra!
Ken: I feel that I've grown as a Trainer<LINE>who can look at POKéMON with a<LINE><LINE>broad mindset.<LINE>I wonder how <PLAYER>, who I met in<LINE>Black City, is doing these days.
Ken: Studying many different POKéMON and<LINE>gaining a lot of far-reaching knowledge<LINE><LINE>widens your world.
But now I'm thinking I'd rather think<LINE>about just one thing very deeply.
When you have a broad mindset, you<LINE>notice things about nature and yourself<LINE><LINE>and about yourself and POKéMON.<LINE>I thought that when I saw a Nidoran⑭<LINE>over there recently.
Jacques: When you see how many different<LINE>POKéMON there are in the world, you<LINE><LINE>understand there are lots of different<LINE><LINE>answers to problems, too.<LINE>When I met <PLAYER> in Black City, I<LINE>felt that Trainer’s way of thinking was<LINE><LINE>one of those answers.
Jacques: Several different answers<LINE>exist for each problem.<LINE>Watching different POKéMON makes me feel<LINE>that way.
But I want to study something<LINE>with a more clear, definite answer…
A variety of POKéMON,<LINE>a variety of answers.<LINE><LINE>All of them equally valid.<LINE>I thought that when I saw a<LINE>Nidoran⑮ over there recently.
Rosa: Here, you can feel growth from<LINE>day to day.<LINE>Before, in Black City, when I battled<LINE><PLAYER>, I thought I hadn't grown<LINE><LINE>at all.
Rosa: Watching the growth of nature lets<LINE>you feel some kind of growth every day.
Well, that may be true, but just watching<LINE>nature gets boring sometimes.<LINE>I don't have anything to do.
Every day of being alive means many small<LINE>changes that give the day meaning.<LINE>I thought that when I saw<LINE>a Whismur recently.
Herman: I've settled in here now, but<LINE>before, when I lived in Black City…<LINE>POKéMON battles with <PLAYER><LINE>sure were fun!
Herman: Living here, surrounded by<LINE>nature, is very calming.
But it's not like me to stay<LINE>in one place forever.
Oh yeah… I just saw a Porygon!<LINE>So strange to see one here… It must<LINE>have taken a liking to the forest.<LINE>I want to live the slow life here, too!
Emi: Right now, I'm on a leisurely<LINE>journey, but before that, I had a goal:<LINE><LINE>to win against <PLAYER> in Black City.
Emi: It's fun to travel as you like, with<LINE>no particular goal in mind.
But maybe it's better to have at least<LINE>some idea of where you're going?
In my travels through this forest, I met<LINE>a Happiny! I was so happy!
Grace: The beauty of the POKéMON battle<LINE>I had with <PLAYER> in Black City<LINE><LINE>can stand up to the beauty of nature!
Grace: The beauty created by nature…<LINE>Its grandness exceeds human imagination.
The beauty I want to see right now is the<LINE>artistry of human hands.<LINE><LINE>I can't satisfy that craving here.
The beauty of the Bagon I just saw was<LINE>natural and good…
White Forest<LINE>People and Nature in Harmony
