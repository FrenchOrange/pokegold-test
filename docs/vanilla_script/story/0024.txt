Your fighting style is so enchanting.<LINE>It is charming.<LINE>You are a Pokémon Trainer<LINE>worthy of receiving this Basic Badge!
<PLAYER> received<LINE>the Basic Badge from Lenora!
If you have two Badges, traded<LINE>Pokémon up to Lv. 30 will obey you.<LINE>Here, I also want you to have this TM.
Retaliate does a lot more damage if an<LINE>ally fainted the turn before you use it!<LINE>If you master the timing, you can defeat<LINE>even strong opponents.
Some problems you can't solve even if you<LINE>think about them your whole life.<LINE>Some problems have different answers<LINE>depending on the person.<LINE>Still, the reason I can't keep my<LINE>curiosity down is this:<LINE><LINE>I want to figure out the truth, but I<LINE><LINE>also have a desire for adventure!
