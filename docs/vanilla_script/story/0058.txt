A beautiful melody makes people happy.<LINE>A sad melody makes people sorrowful...<LINE><LINE>That's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of<LINE>a long-ago melody from the fringes of my<LINE><LINE>sepia-toned memories.<LINE>It was a song my mother loved...<LINE>It makes me feel so nostalgic.<LINE>Would you like to hear the melody?
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that<LINE>played a melody and danced so lightly<LINE><LINE>that it filled people's hearts with joy.<LINE>Then sorrow darkened the entire world,<LINE>and the Pokémon lost the melody...<LINE>Also, at that time, some red shoes<LINE>were lost somewhere...
When you came through the door,<LINE>I remembered the melody!<LINE>And the Pokémon that had forgotten how<LINE>to dance began to step lightly once more!<LINE>You are the inspiration.<LINE>You are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song.<LINE>Aria Forme will become Pirouette Forme,<LINE>and vice versa.
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 remembered<LINE>the Relic Song it had forgotten!


This is your first visit to this café.<LINE>Am I correct?<LINE>Please...
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here.<LINE>Enjoy...
After a tiring day of work, this café is a<LINE>perfect spot to let your mind relax.
When I listen to his guitar, it reminds me<LINE>of leaving home for the first time, and<LINE><LINE>the tears of farewell my mother cried...
