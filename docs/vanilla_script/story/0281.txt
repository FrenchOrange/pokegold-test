This Pokédex is full of memories from your<LINE>journey. It's a treasure you can cherish<LINE><LINE>for your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you<LINE>should try walking through tall grass!
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now!<LINE>You're getting off to a good start!
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't<LINE>give up! Keep checking the tall grass.
Some Pokémon are only found in<LINE>certain caves!<LINE>You might want to go back and search<LINE>caves you've already passed through.
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon.<LINE>So battling them is a great way to fill up<LINE>your Pokédex, too!
Wow, it's getting really full!<LINE>I'm sure looking over your Pokédex will<LINE>bring back memories of your journey.
Over 100 Pokémon...<LINE>It's so much fun looking over all their<LINE>different characteristics!
That is an excellent Pokédex!<LINE>Just a little more and it will be full!
What a wonderful Pokédex!<LINE>A little more work, and it'll be complete!<LINE>I'm really glad I asked you to do this!
Amazing! Truly amazing!<LINE>You've met all of the Pokémon in the<LINE>Unova region!<LINE>Congratulations!<LINE>Now here's your next challenge: see how<LINE>many of those Pokémon you can catch!<LINE><LINE>I'll keep evaluating for you!

It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at<LINE>a good clip!<LINE>Here! This is a gift to thank you for all<LINE>your hard work!
False Swipe is a move that is very helpful<LINE>for catching Pokémon, because it keeps<LINE><LINE>the target from fainting!
Protect is a move that completely<LINE>prevents an attack from hitting!<LINE>Well, there are a few exceptions. Some<LINE>moves, like Feint, can still hit even if<LINE><LINE>Protect is used.
Hidden Power is a mysterious move. Its<LINE>type and power change depending on the<LINE><LINE>Pokémon that learns it!
Try using this, too!
Keep up the good work!
Little by little, more detailed information<LINE>is being entered into the Pokédex!<LINE><LINE>Do your best!
Are you trying out different kinds of<LINE>Poké Balls for your captures?<LINE>They come in lots of varieties, so be sure<LINE>to use the right one at the right time!
If you read the Pokédex descriptions,<LINE>you can learn a lot of unexpected facts<LINE><LINE>about Pokémon! It's fun!
Evolving Pokémon is another important<LINE>way to fill up your Pokédex. It's not<LINE><LINE>just about catching them!
Trading Pokémon with friends also<LINE>counts as catching them!
When you've met this many Pokémon, do<LINE>you have trouble picking which ones to<LINE><LINE>travel with?
This is a very thorough Pokédex.<LINE>It will help my research, too!
You've caught so many Pokémon.<LINE>You might know more than me now!<LINE>I'm rooting for you to complete<LINE>your Pokédex!
With just a little more effort, you will<LINE>complete a perfect Pokédex!<LINE><LINE>You've come this far, so do your best!

So you're here to show me how your<LINE>Pokédex is coming along, right?
I see!<LINE>You've caught \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0000 Pokémon, then...
Oh, really...<LINE>If you want me to have a look at<LINE>your Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than<LINE>600 Pokémon!<LINE>You'll have to be persistent and<LINE>catch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places<LINE>you've already been.<LINE>Retrace your steps in the Unova region<LINE>and see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon,<LINE>you first have to reduce its HP.<LINE>You're pretty good at this now,<LINE>but don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care?<LINE>I've heard that some Pokémon can only be<LINE>caught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod?<LINE>There are many Pokémon that live in the<LINE>water. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe?<LINE>False Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of<LINE>the targeted Pokémon's HP.<LINE>It's great for catching, because it<LINE>doesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look?<LINE>If you use Mean Look on a Pokémon,<LINE>it can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to<LINE>evolve. Some Pokémon even evolve<LINE><LINE>through friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks?<LINE>Big groups of Pokémon appear during a<LINE>mass outbreak. It's a great chance to<LINE><LINE>catch them!
You've caught more than 400<LINE>different Pokémon?!<LINE>That's incredible!<LINE>You're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon<LINE>evolve when they are leveled up<LINE><LINE>in a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon...<LINE>My, the variation of these beings called<LINE>Pokémon certainly is surprising!<LINE>And the fact that you've caught so many<LINE>different kinds... That's pretty<LINE><LINE>surprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab<LINE>on Route 15?<LINE>Mastering a facility like that is an<LINE>accomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete<LINE>your Pokédex, huh?<LINE>Catching this many Pokémon must mean...<LINE>You really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex.<LINE>How about it? Would you research Pokémon<LINE>with me?
Oh! Just a little more until your<LINE>Pokédex is complete!<LINE>Make sure you go after the roaming<LINE>Pokémon and trade with friends to get<LINE><LINE>the ones you're missing!
...<LINE>...<LINE>This blows me away! It's so wonderful,<LINE>I'm at a loss for words.<LINE>You... You've accomplished something<LINE>truly outstanding.<LINE>Filling up the National Pokédex makes you<LINE>a Trainer among Trainers!<LINE>I'm so happy I was able to meet a<LINE>fantastic Trainer like you!<LINE><LINE>I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
