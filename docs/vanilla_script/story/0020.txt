CHEREN: When a POKéMON is poisoned,<LINE>its HP decreases while it is battling.
Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Have you come looking for the<LINE>GYM LEADER?
He was here talking about POKéMON<LINE>types until just a few moments ago…<LINE>Maybe you walked right past him?
Nothing improves your skill as a Trainer<LINE>like real battles.<LINE>That's why challenging GYM LEADERs is<LINE>great practice.
By the way, <PLAYER>, will you have a<LINE>battle with me?<LINE>I want to test how important items are<LINE>in battles.
CHEREN: <PLAYER>, will you have a<LINE>battle with me?<LINE>I want to test how important items are<LINE>in battles.
Really? I really want to try out my<LINE>items, so I'll just wait here until you<LINE><LINE>decide you're ready.
CHEREN: Well, let's see how effective<LINE>my items are…<LINE>Or maybe I should test how well I can<LINE>battle without items…?<LINE>Anyway, this is an indoor match, so let's<LINE>battle without getting too rough!
CHEREN: So learning to use items well is<LINE>definitely important, then.<LINE>Oh, here. <PLAYER>, I'll give you<LINE>these Berries.
CHEREN: If you give a POKéMON this kind<LINE>of Berry to hold, it will eat it to heal up<LINE><LINE>when its HP goes down in battle.<LINE>But if you give POKéMON man-made items<LINE>like Potions to hold, they can't<LINE><LINE>use them.<LINE>Well, good luck, then.
