Hey, <PLAYER>.<LINE>Have you come looking for the<LINE>Gym Leader?
He was here talking about Pokémon<LINE>types until just a few moments ago...<LINE>Maybe you walked right past him?
Nothing improves your skill as a Trainer<LINE>like real battles.<LINE>That's why challenging Gym Leaders is<LINE>great practice.
By the way, <PLAYER>, will you have a<LINE>battle with me?<LINE>I want to test how important items are<LINE>in battles.
Cheren: <PLAYER>, will you have a<LINE>battle with me?<LINE>I want to test how important items are<LINE>in battles.
Really? I really want to try out my<LINE>items, so I'll just wait here until you<LINE><LINE>decide you're ready.
Cheren: Well, let's see how effective<LINE>my items are...<LINE>Or maybe I should test how well I can<LINE>battle without items...?<LINE>Anyway, this is an indoor match, so let's<LINE>battle without getting too rough!
Cheren: So learning to use items well is<LINE>definitely important, then.<LINE>Oh, here. <PLAYER>, I'll give you<LINE>these Berries.
Cheren: If you give a Pokémon this kind<LINE>of Berry to hold, it will eat it to heal up<LINE><LINE>when its HP goes down in battle.<LINE>But if you give Pokémon man-made items<LINE>like Potions to hold, they can't<LINE><LINE>use them.<LINE>Well, good luck, then.
This Trainers' School exists to meet the<LINE>demands of Trainers who want to know<LINE><LINE>more about Pokémon because they<LINE><LINE>love them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers<LINE>called Abilities.<LINE>Abilities have a variety of effects, and<LINE>many of those effects are activated when<LINE><LINE>Pokémon are in battle!
There is a technique that lets you<LINE>cancel evolution!<LINE>I'll read the book about it to you.<LINE>Are you ready?<LINE>“You can surprise a Pokémon and stop its<LINE>evolution by pressing the B Button when<LINE><LINE>a Pokémon is evolving."
Some moves can only be taught with TMs.<LINE>TMs can be used over and over, so you<LINE>might want to use them a lot.<LINE>If you don't like the move you taught,<LINE>you can always use a different TM.
