Cheren: Whew! I finally caught up.
Alder: You two. Come here...<LINE>Come to my side.
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.<LINE>It seems you are working hard<LINE>to resurrect Zekrom, the other<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?<LINE>But it appears the Dark Stone you seek<LINE>is not here.
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here.<LINE>It seems you are working hard<LINE>to resurrect Reshiram, the other<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon, aren't you?<LINE>But it appears the Light Stone you seek<LINE>is not here.
Well then, congratulations are in order!<LINE><PLAYER>, you were chosen by our king.<LINE>If you truly desire to keep the world as<LINE>it is, where Pokémon live alongside<LINE><LINE>people, you must bring the other<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type Pokémon spoken of<LINE><LINE>in legend and battle with our king.<LINE>Otherwise, Team Plasma will steal every<LINE>Pokémon from every person in the world<LINE><LINE>and release them all!
Alder: Release them, you say?<LINE>Do the Pokémon who live with their<LINE>Trainers actually want that?<LINE>Is the liberation you talk about really<LINE>just stealing Pokémon from people?
Ghetsis: What's this?<LINE>Champion Alder, even though illness took<LINE>the Pokémon that had been your partner<LINE><LINE>for many years, and you haven't had a<LINE><LINE>serious battle in all that time...<LINE>Even you, who ordered the Elite Four to<LINE>protect the Pokémon League and left to<LINE><LINE>wander the Unova region alone...<LINE>Even a Champion like you now wants to<LINE>protect a world where Pokémon and<LINE><LINE>people live together?
Team Plasma's king will show the people of<LINE>Unova that he is stronger than a<LINE><LINE>Champion who keeps Pokémon bound!<LINE>And just like the hero who founded<LINE>Unova, he will be accompanied by the<LINE><LINE>legendary Pokémon.<LINE>He will give this order!<LINE>“Trainers, release your Pokémon!"<LINE>For this, we have prepared a suitable<LINE>castle for the legendary Reshiram and<LINE><LINE>our king!

Alder: I won't lose!<LINE>I'll fight for all Trainers who love their<LINE>Pokémon, and for all Pokémon who believe<LINE><LINE>in their Trainers!
Ghetsis: Our king has no interest in you.<LINE>He has already determined that victory<LINE>against you is assured.
Alder: So you stayed behind just to<LINE>tell me that? Just to make a fool of me?
Ghetsis: Of course not.<LINE>I'm doing this out of kindness.<LINE>Yes, kindness.<LINE>I'm making sure the Champion doesn't<LINE>get hurt for no reason.<LINE>Granted, the moment when<LINE>someone loses all hope...<LINE>I really do love to watch<LINE>that moment.<LINE>Well then, farewell.
Cheren: Alder...<LINE>What are you going to do now?
Alder: Hmmm...<LINE>It seems my only choice is to return to<LINE>the Pokémon League and battle N.<LINE>But it bothers me to do exactly what<LINE>Ghetsis wants...<LINE>More importantly, what should we do<LINE>about the Dark Stone?

Cheren: Alder...<LINE>Why don't we go outside for now?
Alder: Yes...that's a good idea.<LINE>It's hard to breathe in here!
