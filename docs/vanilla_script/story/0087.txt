To be good at something, you have to do<LINE>it repeatedly, day after day after day.<LINE>That's how you get results.<LINE>Otherwise, you won't get better at it.
When I was a kid, I played catch with<LINE>my POKéMON!
It's not bad to grow up.<LINE>But it's bad to forget what it felt like<LINE>to be a child.
I have baseball, and I have POKéMON…<LINE>How happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit<LINE>a ball.<LINE>If you don't do things, you won't fail…<LINE>but you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the<LINE>time! That is the only thing I can do.
What I brag about is my bat!
