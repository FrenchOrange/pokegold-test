Greetings, challenger.<LINE>My name is Marshal.<LINE>In order to master the art of fighting,<LINE>I'm training under my mentor, Alder.<LINE>My mentor sees your potential as a<LINE>Trainer and is taking an interest in you.<LINE>It is my intention to test you--to take<LINE>you to the limits of your strength. Kiai!
Whew! Well done!<LINE>As your battles continue,<LINE>aim for even greater heights!
Representing the Pokémon League in the<LINE>absence of the Champion has been my duty<LINE><LINE>as Alder's student.<LINE>However, there is nothing as empty as<LINE>words not backed up by strength.<LINE>A word in your ear, strong challenger...<LINE>The other members of the Elite Four<LINE><LINE>are far more powerful than I am.<LINE>Do not underestimate them!
Now... You have become the strongest<LINE>Trainer in this Pokémon League.<LINE>The statue in the central chamber will<LINE>take you to the Champion's room.<LINE>We, the Elite Four of Unova,<LINE>are sworn to follow the Champion's order<LINE><LINE>to be neutral.<LINE>So the rest is up to you!
I thank you deeply for the chance for<LINE>another round of combat against you.<LINE>In myself, I seek to develop<LINE>the strength of a fighter.<LINE>And shatter any weakness in myself!<LINE>Prevailing with the force of<LINE>my convictions!<LINE>Victory, decisive victory, is my intention!<LINE>Challenger, here I come!
There are still many strong Trainers<LINE>in this Pokémon League.<LINE>You should deepen your bonds with<LINE>your Pokémon by battling with them.
In times past, I wandered all the regions<LINE>of the world in pursuit of strength...<LINE>One day, I met my mentor and began to<LINE>grasp the wisdom of making strength<LINE><LINE>an internal quality...<LINE>And one day, I decided to become part of<LINE>the Elite Four of Unova...<LINE>For some reason, the battle we just had<LINE>brought those fateful times back to mind.
The strength shown by you and your<LINE>Pokémon has deeply impressed me...<LINE>Please, continue to the next room<LINE>to face the strongest Trainer<LINE><LINE>of the Unova region!
