\xf000븉\x0001\x0001First, I must tell you...<LINE>I am the king of Team Plasma.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001Ghetsis asked me to work with him to save<LINE>the Pokémon.\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
\xf000븉\x0001\x0001I wonder how many Pokémon<LINE>exist in this world...\xf000븉\x0001\x0000
Wow... As I thought, it's high...<LINE>Ah... I may be getting scared...
Ugh... It's swaying... Isn't it? It is!<LINE>I'm scared of how high up we are...
Ahh... No, no... This is my limit.<LINE>Here... Sit a little closer, OK?
It's getting higher and higher...<LINE>Ulp. This is going faster than I thought.
Oh! Come look here!<LINE>Look! Ulp, I'm not feeling so good...
... ... ... ... ... ...<LINE>... ... ... ... ... ...
I thought I'd enjoy this ride, but I feel<LINE>like I'm enclosed in a tiny little space...
Luckily, I'm not scared of heights.<LINE>That would not be cool for a Hiker.
I'm gonna stay cool. Feel cool on the<LINE>inside, look cool on the outside.
Uh-oh. It's higher than I thought.<LINE>Ulp. It's swaying more than I expected.
Oh! Don't move! We'll fall!<LINE>Do...not...move...
Eep... I can't take it. This is my limit.<LINE>W-w-will you hold my hand?
It's a great view... G-great...<LINE>B-b-but...
I'm not crying. I'm not...<LINE>Sorry... Can I sit next to you?
Just...just until we start to descend...<LINE>Please...stay...
Um-hmm...<LINE>Since we have time, shall we talk?
Um-hm... That's right... No way!<LINE>Then... Um-hmm... Yes, yes... Um-hm...
Said...I like you... Such a lie.<LINE>It turned out there was... Uh-huh...
Yay! Yaaaay! It's going round and round!<LINE>Yaaay! Yaaaay! It's going up and up!
Yaaaay! So high up! Up in the sky!<LINE>Hee hee. It's fun!
Look how far we can see!<LINE>Look! Please, Trainer?
The city is getting smaller and smaller...<LINE>Such a pretty sight...
Krrf! Krrrf! Krrrf!<LINE>Sorry... It's a bit chilly for me...
I think it's finally warming up. I'm<LINE>feeling better. Thanks for the company.
