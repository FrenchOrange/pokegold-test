A Trainer catches another Trainer's eye.<LINE>That is the start of a Pokémon battle!
What?!<LINE>You are too strong!
I'll go into the tall grass and<LINE>have battles with wild Pokémon!<LINE>But, before that, I have to visit<LINE>the Pokémon Center to heal up my team.
I really love Pokémon battles!<LINE>'Cause my cute Pokémon will do its best<LINE>in a really cute way!
Even though it lost,<LINE>my Pokémon is still cute!
I'll make my cute Pokémon even stronger<LINE>by having battles with lots of Trainers!
Lillipup, Lillipup!<LINE>My Lillipup! Go!
Your Pokémon uses those kinds of moves?!
Different Trainers use<LINE>different kinds of Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>That's fun to see, isn't it?
Check out how much my Pokémon<LINE>have grown up!
Oh. I guess they're still pretty green.
You are great!<LINE>This is a present for you.
Thank you very much.<LINE>I learned a lot about how I should<LINE>train my Pokémon from battling you.
Your Pokémon look quite good!<LINE>Would you show me how<LINE>you've been training them?
Oh, I see!<LINE>You've trained them by traveling together!
Please, let your precious Pokémon<LINE>have this.
I guess when Pokémon and Trainers<LINE>spend that much time together,<LINE><LINE>they naturally understand each other!
I feel invincible because I am surrounded<LINE>by the smiles of children and Pokémon!
Wow! Great, great!<LINE>You are very strong!
Speak while making eye contact, and<LINE>express your feelings to each other...<LINE><LINE>It's the same for people and Pokémon.

Kumi: Come on, Pokémon! Get up! Go!<LINE>Amy: Oh, no! Our Pokémon burned out...

Eh? Only one Pokémon?<LINE>Are you really a Trainer?



You have only one Pokémon?<LINE>Are you really a Trainer?
Hey! Trainer!<LINE>Have a battle with me!
Oops. I have no healthy Pokémon<LINE>left to fight...
Argh! You went all out against a kid!<LINE>...Actually, that's a good thing. Thanks!
Take this!<LINE>Hyper Beam!
Whoops...
Hyper Beam?<LINE>Oh, my Pokémon can't really use it yet.<LINE>I don't know very much about Pokémon,<LINE>so I just want to use really cool moves.
Trainer! <LINE>I wanna play with you.
Trainer!<LINE>You too strong!
When I get big, I wanna be<LINE>a strong, cool Trainer, too!
Now I get to show off everything<LINE>I learned in the Trainers' School!
Argh...
I was so overwhelmed by your greatness<LINE>that I forgot everything I learned!<LINE><LINE>I need to keep my wits during a battle.
I was just thinking<LINE>about a new battle strategy!
A new battle strategy only works<LINE>if you stick with it...
I know all kinds of things! Like if you<LINE>walk through the swaying tall grass,<LINE><LINE>you might find a cool Pokémon!
Even if Pokémon have not been fully<LINE>trained, they can show their potential<LINE><LINE>depending on their Trainer's style.
Oh, that's really frustrating!
I feel sorry for Pokémon when they lose<LINE>because their Trainer lacks skill...<LINE><LINE>A Trainer has a huge responsibility.
The fun of traveling around the world<LINE>is having serious battles<LINE><LINE>with a lot of Pokémon I meet!
Wooo! You're a top-class Trainer,<LINE>the best in the world!<LINE><LINE>...But what do I know?
As long as my Pokémon are with me,<LINE>I can battle Trainers all over the world!<LINE>The world is so big! Woooooo!<LINE>That's really exciting!
Where did you come from?<LINE>Me? Well, if you can win, I'll tell you!
My first battle...<LINE>And I lost...
To tell you the truth,<LINE>I just left Castelia City yesterday.<LINE><LINE>I've just started Pokémon battling, too.
I'm still a rookie, but someday<LINE>I will be a great player!<LINE>I'll improve by having a lot<LINE>of Pokémon battles!
Ugh!<LINE>I missed the rebound!
I won't make excuses for losing!<LINE>Why waste time dreaming up excuses?<LINE>I'll spend that time getting stronger!
A young Trainer! It's important for the<LINE>young to get lots of exercise, isn't it?
A good sweat...<LINE>Boy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
I want a Poké Ball that's<LINE>as big as a basketball!<LINE>I think it would be more comfortable<LINE>for the Pokémon inside it.
You've been caught by a powerful hook,<LINE>which is me!<LINE>I'll have a battle with you using<LINE>my freshly caught Pokémon!
Oh, no! The one who was caught...<LINE>was me!
I usually release the Pokémon I catch.<LINE>That's called catch and release!<LINE><LINE>When I release them, I say these words:<LINE>Farewell, Pokémon.<LINE>It was a nice fight.<LINE>I'll say these words to you, too.<LINE>It was a nice fight!
OK! Good catch! Good catch!<LINE>My next catch will be called victory!
The victory that got away<LINE>was thiiiiiiiiiis big!
Catch, caught, and catch again...<LINE>Life is fishing!
Ho there! Even in the middle of<LINE>construction, a Trainer will battle.
Gah! I'm digging myself into a big hole!
If you use a Pokémon move called Dig,<LINE>you can get out of a cave instantly!
I'm a mucho macho Worker!<LINE>I'll bring you down with my muscles!
Argh!<LINE>The impudence!
I dismissed you as just a kid...<LINE>Not at all... You're quite a Trainer!
A battle is like a construction project.<LINE>They're both a piece of cake for me!
Ooh... That piece of cake was<LINE>hard to swallow!
I may have lost in the battle, but I bow<LINE>to nobody when it comes to construction!<LINE>You must have something like that, right?<LINE>Something you do better than anybody?
We've trained by doing physical work!<LINE>Our attacks are super powerful!
We've trained by doing physical work.<LINE>So even when we lose, we're powerful!
This Worker is happy to have a job that<LINE>lets him be with his favorite Pokémon!
Hi, Trainer!<LINE>Let me turn you into a work of art!
Oh, I just got whitewashed!
The reason why there are so many colors<LINE>in this world...white, black, red, green,<LINE><LINE>blue, yellow...is that they can be mixed<LINE><LINE>to create an explosion of new color!<LINE>Boom!
As my mind roams, as the wind blows,<LINE>destiny has brought us to this battle.
Urgh... I didn't know<LINE>I was flying against the wind...
I want to fly around the Unova region,<LINE>blown by the wind!
This big bag...<LINE>What do you think is inside?
I lost, but now I have more things<LINE>to add to my bag.
I'll tell you a secret. The things I put<LINE>in the bag are memories of my journey!<LINE>The things you can't see are very heavy!
These Pokémon usually help me bake.<LINE>Today, they'll help me battle you!
Oh, my...<LINE>It was a tasty battle.
I get on well with my Pokémon, and we<LINE>bake bread together. It's so much fun!<LINE><LINE>I don't mind getting up early every day.
Turn around, and it's my turn. ♪<LINE>Turn around, and it's your turn.
Turn around, turn around, turn around...
It's difficult to have a battle while<LINE>tapping my toes.<LINE>But I am a Dancer!<LINE>It is natural to dance!
I will show you all the moves<LINE>that my Pokémon have mastered!
I am sorry that I underestimated<LINE>you and your Pokémon's moves!
Sometimes a battle is so beautiful<LINE>that it takes your breath away.<LINE>Ours was such a battle!
It is best to try anything!<LINE>You think so, too, don't you?
There's a rhythm to attacking<LINE>and defending...<LINE><LINE>I think ours got thrown off.
The guitar is expression itself.<LINE>Let's enjoy playing the guitar,<LINE>rather than just talking about it!<LINE>A Pokémon is also expression itself.<LINE>Let's enjoy battling!
I cannot see the future yet...<LINE>The world is still to be determined...
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>...What? Did we lose?
I cannot believe that Team Plasma<LINE>lost to such kids!
I've finally become a Trainer...<LINE>Everything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying<LINE>Pokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...<LINE>Everything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying<LINE>Pokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
I've finally become a Trainer...<LINE>Everything starts from here!
It's not over yet! I've been studying<LINE>Pokémon to prepare for this moment!
Ah! So that's a Pokémon battle!
Eek! Ouch!<LINE>I won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and<LINE>this isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!<LINE>I won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and<LINE>this isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
Eek! Ouch!<LINE>I won't let you get away with that!
I'm kinda nervous, and<LINE>this isn't going well at all!
The Pokémon on both sides did their best!
More!<LINE>Let me hear the voice of your Pokémon!
I never expected to hear<LINE>Pokémon say such things...
My Psychic-type Pokémon<LINE>just started making noises.<LINE>Is that because we're in the ruins...<LINE>or is it because of you?
So...strong!<LINE>Who are you?!
It is said that long ago, these ruins<LINE>were the heart of civilization for people<LINE><LINE>and Pokémon in the Unova region.
Just being here fills me<LINE>with magical power...
You seem to be<LINE>full of magical power, too...
In ancient places,<LINE>magical energy remains...<LINE>I can understand it.<LINE>So much sorrow and joy...
As if that would work on my Pokémon!
It's not over yet! One more left!<LINE>This is where I give it my all!
You got me.<LINE>I am...burned...out...
I see...<LINE>That might be a good attack.
I'll put all of my hopes<LINE>on my last Pokémon!
Lose? Me?<LINE>I don't believe this.
Ah!<LINE>My Pokémon!
Huh? Could it be?<LINE>Could I have only one Pokémon left?
Er...<LINE>Is it over now?
Welcome to Striaton Gym!<LINE>Care for a taste of battle?<LINE>I'll serve up the first course!
Yow!<LINE>You're a Trainer with a lot of pepper!
I think it is all right to move ahead<LINE>with Pokémon you've trained well, even<LINE><LINE>without thinking about type matchups.
The specialty of Striaton Gym--<LINE>the full-course “Trainer de luxe!"<LINE><LINE>I'm your second course.
That was one of our most popular dishes.<LINE>Did you enjoy the battle?
The specialty of Striaton Gym--<LINE>the full-course “Trainer de luxe!"<LINE><LINE>To complete your repast--a Gym Leader.
Now, with that move, I'm starting to see<LINE>what kind of Trainer you are!
No matter how grim the situation, I'll use my<LINE>research skills to find a winning strategy!
My theory about you was correct.<LINE>You're more than just talented...<LINE>You're motivated! I salute you!
I hang around Nacrene Gym all the time.<LINE>People call me a bookworm.<LINE>I'll warn you now... I am strong because<LINE>I spend the entire day either<LINE><LINE>reading books or training Pokémon.
I may be a bookworm,<LINE>but I am not a bug Pokémon.
My first recommendation is a book called<LINE>“Nice to Meet You, Pokémon."<LINE>The bookshelves for children's books<LINE>are close to the entrance.
Oh, wow!<LINE>I lost, but thanks for a great battle!
I've never known anyone so powerful.<LINE>My head is empty compared to yours!
Snick!<LINE>My switch was turned on!
Could it be time to bug out of here?<LINE>No, no. I refuse to be squashed!
Is it over?<LINE>Has my muse abandoned me?
You and your Pokémon...<LINE>are shining brilliantly!
A properly dramatic victory requires<LINE>a dash of danger and a pinch of peril.
I meant to make your head spin,<LINE>but you shocked me instead.
Even though I lost,<LINE>I'm an ocean of calm...
Welcome, challenger!<LINE>I will do you the greatest of honors<LINE>and accept your challenge!
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll on!<LINE>Roller coaster!
I was aiming for a fighting style<LINE>that overwhelms you with speed...<LINE>If I can move faster than my opponents,<LINE>I will get the upper hand.
I lost, but I will think a lot harder,<LINE>and that will make me a lot stronger!
Your fashion sense...<LINE>It's kind of Nuvema Town-ish.
Oh, no!<LINE>I thought I'd be the fashionista!
Elesa controls an elegant Gym<LINE>in elegant Nimbasa City.<LINE><LINE>She has an essential elegance.<LINE><LINE>You should be her fan, too!
I'll be!<LINE>Sure didn't see that coming.
Givin' up's the easy way out! If I wanted,<LINE>I could have given up any old time!
Well, I've had enough... And just so you<LINE>know, I didn't go easy on you.
When I think about a match<LINE>with a fabulous Trainer like you,<LINE><LINE>it's like I'm walking on air!
This is my last Pokémon...<LINE>But I'll never give up hope!
Being your opponent in battle is a new<LINE>source of strength to me. Thank you!
I became a Pilot, which has been<LINE>my dream since I was a child.<LINE><LINE>I am extremely strong! Bring it on!
Altitude is dropping slowly...<LINE>I will prepare for landing.
I became a Pilot, making the dream<LINE>of my younger days a reality...<LINE><LINE>The weight is quite comfortable.
Target lock acquired!<LINE>I will shoot you down<LINE>with my flight technique!
What?!<LINE>I missed the target.
We can depend on a move that<LINE>hits without fail when it counts.<LINE>For example, Aerial Ace and Swift<LINE>are both surefire moves!
The best Trainer of Ice-type Pokémon<LINE>in the Cold Storage...<LINE><LINE>That's me!
Oh, no... I will train even harder<LINE>at the Icirrus Gym.
The Gym Leader in Icirrus City<LINE>uses Ice-type Pokémon!<LINE>If you train your body and mind there,<LINE>you'll be fine with cold!
The pure chill of the Cold Storage!<LINE>Taste how cold it is!
Chilly?<LINE>I feel the shiver pass along my spine.
There are a lot of Trainers,<LINE>even in the Cold Storage.



We!<LINE>We are training here!<LINE>Now let's train<LINE>Pokémon together!
Great!<LINE>You have a talent as a Trainer!
I want to win against Gym Leaders,<LINE>but I want to win against you, too!
My goal is to outperform Gym Leaders!<LINE>Can you win against me?!
My Pokémon fought well, didn't they?
I have my goal!<LINE>My Pokémon are there for me!<LINE><LINE>That's why I can keep trying!
POWER!<LINE>Power is essential for both<LINE>Pokémon and football!
Didn't I have enough power...?
I am training to be the very best<LINE>with my Pokémon!
An elegant Smasher<LINE>has an elegant battle!
E-e-even though I lost,<LINE>I won't panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't<LINE>be chagrined at losing the battle!
The qualifying round is coming soon.<LINE>I will practice smashes<LINE>by using you as a wall!
Oh, whew! Must...catch...my breath.<LINE>That was some good training...
You and I have just met!<LINE>Let's start this game from the beginning.
One-two, one-two! Keep time with<LINE>each other, and one-two punch!
Mayo: Two of us keeping time together...<LINE>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!<LINE>May: Two of us keeping time together...<LINE>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
It would be even greater if we knew<LINE>what two Pokémon will do.
You've got only one Pokémon,<LINE>so we cannot fight.
We discuss what to do<LINE>before a battle.

What I've heard is it's good to use<LINE>Earthquake when your ally is floating!
If you want to have a battle with us, <LINE>you need two Pokémon.
...Interrupting us!<LINE>What a horrible Trainer!
If you take something away,<LINE>I will take it back... Remember that!
Look, look! This is a Gym Badge<LINE>from Striaton City!<LINE>Oh, you have it, too!<LINE>Then let's have a Pokémon battle<LINE><LINE>to see who is stronger!
Impressive! A battle with a<LINE>Gym Badge holder is different!
You know, there's a pedestal at the<LINE>entrance of each Pokémon Gym.<LINE>If you get that Gym's Badge,<LINE>your name will be carved there.
I patrol Pinwheel Forest every day!<LINE>A battle here is a piece of cake!
What a huge mistake to lose<LINE>a battle in Pinwheel Forest!
A Ranger always has one of these.<LINE>I'll give it to you!
The forest is alive...<LINE>Something changes every day,<LINE>so it's fun to patrol!
Blend into the wilderness<LINE>and talk to Pokémon with your heart.<LINE><LINE>That is a Ranger!
Did you feel my wildness?
I'm sure you can fully<LINE>utilize this.
If you blend into the wilderness too well,<LINE>you won't be noticed by Pokémon,<LINE><LINE>let alone by people.<LINE><LINE>That is a problem...
Come on! Let's take<LINE>a deep breath.<LINE>Inhale, exhale.<LINE>Inhale, exhale.<LINE>All right! Next,<LINE>let our Pokémon fight!
In this situation...<LINE>All that comes out is a sigh...
Well, a sigh and this lovely gift for you!
Different Pokémon can be found<LINE>in different places.<LINE>Does that mean there is<LINE>a perfect place for everyone?
Get great powers drawn from nature<LINE>without opposing it.<LINE><LINE>That is the strength of Rangers!
You and your Pokémon make a great team!
This is one of the powers<LINE>I got from nature.
Even the things you can't do alone,<LINE>if you're with someone else...<LINE>That's right. We always<LINE>have Pokémon around us.<LINE><LINE>Isn't that great?
Why do Pokémon and people<LINE>stay together...?<LINE><LINE>That's the theme of my research.
A ray of light shone in...<LINE>I feel a little like that.
Why do Pokémon and people<LINE>stay together...?<LINE>I think we stick together<LINE>because we are different.
If I apply what I just learned<LINE>to the battle, I think I can win!
I've even won against my teacher, though...
Knowing something and being<LINE>able to do it seem pretty similar,<LINE><LINE>but they can be very different.
My Pokémon's strong points!<LINE>You'll see them if you fight!
Hey! Did you see<LINE>my Pokémon's strong points?!
My Pokémon's strong points?<LINE>Hmmm...<LINE>I don't know 'cause there are too many!
When it's cold, wear a lot of clothes!<LINE>Only humans could come up<LINE>with something so clever!
How we struggle in vain at the end<LINE>also shows how clever humans are!
I'll tell you something clever.<LINE>If you use a Fire-type move on a Pokémon<LINE>that is frozen solid, the ice will melt!
Although I am in the Cold Storage,<LINE>my heart is burning!
Oh, no!
Some Pokémon grow stronger<LINE>when they get colder,<LINE><LINE>while some Pokémon love hot places.<LINE>That's right! Everyone is different!<LINE>Every Pokémon is different!
You're pretty energetic,<LINE>considering the cold place we're in!<LINE>Let's warm up with a Pokémon battle!
I warmed up, but I lost the battle,<LINE>and my heart is freezing...
I am storing thick fat<LINE>to resist the cold.<LINE>...I didn't just get fat.<LINE>Please don't get me wrong.
...<LINE>...R-ready to b-battle?
...<LINE>...I'm sh-shivering!
...<LINE>...Kn-know what?<LINE>...Th-this place is cold.
A traveling Backpacker<LINE>meets a traveling Trainer.
I may have been traveling<LINE>to meet you... Just kidding!
My journey taught me that a journey<LINE>is not just going somewhere.<LINE>Meeting people and learning from them<LINE>are both part of my journey.
I wanted to go to the Celestial Tower...<LINE>but I got lost and stranded.
Ah! I cannot go anywhere<LINE>if I am stopping!
To go to the Celestial Tower...<LINE>Walk along the road! That's right!<LINE>If you keep walking, someday<LINE>you'll arrive at your destination.
Oh! A Pokédex!<LINE>I see. That is the reason<LINE>for your journey!
Impressive! That's what you'd expect<LINE>from the owner of a Pokédex!
I've heard that both Professor Junipers<LINE>were Backpackers when they were young.
My travel partner is a Pokémon<LINE>that a popular guidebook recommended!
The guidebook does not tell me<LINE>how to win.
According to the popular guidebook,<LINE>Nimbasa City is an entertainment city.<LINE><LINE>It must be full of fun!
Do you want to pass through here?<LINE>Then, you must greet me!
You!!<LINE>What great strength you have!
For a child like you, <LINE>a Bicycle is just right!<LINE><LINE>It is healthier, isn't it?
Heheh!<LINE>Nobody can beat my speed and fury!
I have lost!<LINE>I am such a loser!
Ah! I wish I could fly down<LINE>a much, much bigger road.<LINE><LINE>The Pokémon would be happy, too!
Hey, hey, what have we here, boys?<LINE>You have good Pokémon.<LINE>Let me see!
Jim: G-good Pokémon.<LINE>To be honest, they are dazzling!<LINE>Cas: WHAT?<LINE>How could bad men like us lose...?
There are good Pokémon,<LINE>but there are no bad Pokémon.<LINE>Everything is up to the Trainer.<LINE>That's what I think!
You've got only one Pokémon?<LINE>A single battle is so boring!
Hey, hey! A bad one teamed up<LINE>with another bad one!<LINE>Do you know what it means?<LINE>That means we are very bad!

Even bad men like us<LINE>can be friends!<LINE>What a great thing!<LINE>Friendship between men<LINE><LINE>and friendship with Pokémon...
What? You've only got one<LINE>Pokémon that can fight?<LINE>I cannot take a cheap shot,<LINE>fighting two against one!
I'm a little bit strong.<LINE>I will work out!
I got worked over...
You're quite strong.<LINE>You have left the Little League!
Hey!<LINE>Hey, let's practice together!<LINE>I have to warn you--I will go all out<LINE>even if we are just practicing!
I was no match for you...<LINE>There is always someone better.
I promise you!<LINE>I will learn from this experience<LINE>and become an even better player!
There is no end<LINE>to mastering Pokémon battles!
There is an end<LINE>for this battle!
It's hard to have no end,<LINE>but if you change your perspective,<LINE><LINE>you'll see we can enjoy them forever!
I want to know how<LINE>the fighting Pokémon feel.<LINE>That's why I fight, too.<LINE>That's me, a Battle Girl!
When I lose, I cry with my Pokémon!<LINE>That's me, a Battle Girl!
When you train every day,<LINE>your body moves as you like.<LINE><LINE>It feels really good!
I test the challenge rock<LINE>with my fist every day!<LINE>It is important to make steady progress,<LINE>little by little.
I still have not<LINE>tried hard enough!
I test the challenge rock every day<LINE>with my Pokémon!<LINE>Why don't you check out<LINE>the challenge rock<LINE><LINE>with a Fighting-type Pokémon?
I am pleased to meet you.<LINE>Please allow me to introduce you<LINE>to my Pokémon.
I had the honor of meeting<LINE>your Pokémon!
Well, well, you are strong!<LINE>I admire you.<LINE><LINE>I would like to learn by watching you!
Clerks exchange business cards.<LINE>Trainers, of course, greet each other<LINE>with a Pokémon battle!
What an impressive greeting!<LINE>That was a great Pokémon battle!
When I was a child,<LINE>I traveled with Pokémon...<LINE>Of course, I am still raising Pokémon!<LINE>'Cause Pokémon are my friends for life!
My work is a Pokémon battle!
Today's work<LINE>didn't go well...
Our company develops goods<LINE>for Pokémon and Trainers.<LINE>So, Pokémon battles are also<LINE>an important part of my work!
I received intense training from Clay.<LINE>No Trainer around here<LINE>is out of my league.
Oh, no...<LINE>I've found someone who's out of my league!
Clay is a Gym Leader and<LINE>a company president.<LINE><LINE>And he scolds me all the time.
I was about to take a break,<LINE>then I met you!
This encounter was a good one...<LINE>for you!
I met my Pokémon<LINE>more than ten years ago.<LINE><LINE>I trust them.
Even the battle I lost<LINE>will be a bittersweet memory...
Wow, you really cleaned up!
When Pokémon Trainers meet,<LINE>what we do is, of course,<LINE><LINE>engage in a Pokémon battle, don't we?
Oh no...<LINE>I'm pathetic...
Perhaps I meet people here because of<LINE>guidance from my Pokémon.
Oh?<LINE>You want to have a battle with me?<LINE>All right!<LINE>I have a strong Pokémon.
That's right.<LINE>The Pokémon is no longer with me.
...The Pokémon is no longer with me.<LINE>...That's not true.<LINE>As long as I remember,<LINE><LINE>it will be with me forever.
If you like, I will make<LINE>your Pokémon healthy!<LINE>However! Let me challenge you<LINE>to a battle first!
What? <LINE>Did MY Pokémon lose energy?
Now, as I promised,<LINE>I will make your Pokémon healthy.
To make people healthy,<LINE>Doctors go where they are needed.
During a long journey,<LINE>you'll be happy if you meet a Doctor.<LINE>If you can win against me,<LINE>I'll make your Pokémon healthy!
Your team is very healthy. Let me<LINE>just fix your team up a little bit...
After a Pokémon battle,<LINE>let them recover slowly.
Health is always crucial!<LINE>It really is.
I've survived a lot of fierce battles<LINE>with my Pokémon!<LINE>I don't think I will lose!
The one who survived<LINE>fierce battles was you?!
My heart is not broken.<LINE>I will survive further fierce battles<LINE>with my Pokémon,<LINE><LINE>and I will become much stronger.
Take this!<LINE>The winning strategy I've developed!
Sigh...<LINE>I feel down.
I feel down only briefly!<LINE>I am a Trainer. If I give up,<LINE>my Pokémon cannot do anything! Right?
I will test you to see whether<LINE>you have what it takes...<LINE>to aim for the Pokémon League!
I see! I see, I see!<LINE>I see, I see, I see, I see!
They say that there is a strong Champion<LINE>in the Pokémon League.<LINE>Someday, I will be able to challenge<LINE>the Pokémon League!
I am an Ace Trainer!<LINE>Basically, I am very strong.<LINE>The Unova region will be shaken<LINE>if I lose.
...The meaning of my existence<LINE>is being threatened right now!
Someday, your existence will shake<LINE>this Unova region!<LINE>My loss looks more impressive<LINE>if I praise you as a hotshot.
Hey! My Pokémon are great.<LINE>Look, look!
Argh!
I am called an Ace Trainer, but<LINE>that doesn't sit well with me.<LINE>'Cause I just love Pokémon,<LINE>and I just want to be strong!
Even at an electrified place like this,<LINE>if somebody challenges me,<LINE><LINE>I will take that challenge.<LINE><LINE>That is an Ace Trainer!
Hmmm...<LINE>I am electrified!
Bits of knowledge about electricity!<LINE>An electric current runs from plus<LINE>to minus, and an electron runs<LINE><LINE>from minus to plus.
I'm really serious about training.<LINE>I even visit this electrified cave<LINE>to train myself and my Pokémon!
The electric shock racing...<LINE>Me falling down...
Some Pokémon like to live<LINE>in this electrified cave...<LINE>Don't you think that people<LINE>should stay out?
I've improved my ability<LINE>by fighting strong opponents,<LINE><LINE>catching them, and overtaking them!<LINE>You're strong!<LINE>I'll overtake you at all costs!
I was far from catching up with you...<LINE>You are no ordinary person!!
No time to feel down after a defeat!<LINE>If moaning over a loss made me strong,<LINE>I would bemoan a loss forever, though.
What pleases sleeping spirits<LINE>is a hot Pokémon battle!
It's a spark of your flaming spirit!
When I come here... At Celestial Tower,<LINE>strangely, I feel the urge to fight.<LINE>Does that prove I am alive?
I'm here to understand the end<LINE>of the world, but I don't quite get it.<LINE>If I have a battle,<LINE>will I be enlightened...?
The end...<LINE>Is that it?
People, Pokémon...<LINE>Even if the world is gone,<LINE><LINE>that is not the end.<LINE><LINE>I feel sure of it.
Indescribable energy<LINE>is flowing to me!
The energy is escaping...<LINE>Aww...
A lot of energies are swirling<LINE>around in the world,<LINE><LINE>including hopes and dreams.
...I still want to fight!<LINE>Wandering spirits command me!
Lemme breathe a sec...<LINE>The spirits have calmed down a bit.
In a way...the Celestial Tower<LINE>is a space full of desires to live.
Watching a practice makes you feel<LINE>that you are stronger, too,<LINE><LINE>doesn't it?<LINE><LINE>So let's have a battle!
Hawk: ...I could not<LINE>do it well at all.<LINE>Dar: ...I could not<LINE>do it right at all.
They can do even the hardest things<LINE>as if they were so simple...<LINE>That's the great thing<LINE>about professionals.
We cannot have<LINE>a one-on-two battle.
We were watching various team sports,<LINE>and we wanted to fight as a duo, too!

Playing as a team is difficult.<LINE>We could do more great things<LINE>if we could understand what<LINE><LINE>other people were thinking!
We would like to have<LINE>a Pokémon battle as a duo.
I get excited just by<LINE>coming to this stadium!!
Joe: I got super excited!<LINE>Ross: What a thrill!<LINE>It's taking my breath away!
Just by being here! Just by watching it!<LINE>I get really excited!<LINE>If I played a game here,<LINE>I would be extremely excited!
We don't want to have<LINE>a one-on-two battle.
If we fight in this stadium,<LINE>don't you think we will understand<LINE><LINE>how our star players feel?

We had a battle with Pokémon<LINE>in the stadium...<LINE>I am happy 'cause I experienced<LINE>what star players feel!
One-on-two? <LINE>We cannot fight like that.
Watching people practicing<LINE>makes me want to get moving, too!<LINE>Soooooo, let's practice<LINE>Pokémon battles.
Masa: I laugh even though<LINE>we lost because it was fun!<LINE>Yas: Ah! I didn't cheer enough<LINE>for our Pokémon.
It's way more fun to have a battle<LINE>ourselves than watching<LINE><LINE>other people practicing!
We cannot have<LINE>a one-on-two battle.
We usually cheer for other people,<LINE>but today we would like<LINE><LINE>to gather our courage<LINE><LINE>and have our own Pokémon battle.

I am not good at sports,<LINE>but I enjoy sports in my own way--<LINE><LINE>by cheering my heart out for people!
You have only one Pokémon<LINE>that can fight. It's out of the question.
Watching athletes practice with Pokémon<LINE>made me want to have a Pokémon battle.
Kay: Great!<LINE>You are like a professional!<LINE>Ali: How did you know?
Ohhh... I knew it was difficult<LINE>to fight with Pokémon as well as<LINE><LINE>the professionals do.
We are two!<LINE>We use two Pokémon, too!
Pokémon do<LINE>what I cannot do.<LINE>You know how wonderful this is,<LINE>don't you?

Even existing sports shine<LINE>with new appeal<LINE><LINE>when they team up with Pokémon!
Aren't you in trouble if you don't have<LINE>more Pokémon that can fight?
Which do you like better,<LINE>tennis or basketball?
Ami: The game ended<LINE>before I knew what was going on.<LINE>Eira: The combination of you<LINE>and your Pokémon is great!
I love both tennis and basketball!<LINE>I can't choose just one of them, just<LINE>like I can't choose my favorite Pokémon.
What? You have only one<LINE>Pokémon that can fight?
We are always together!<LINE>Our combination play must be great!

Be in sync with your partner,<LINE>and with your Pokémon, too.<LINE><LINE>Tag Battles are tough!<LINE>But if you are in sync,<LINE>it will be very exciting!
You have only one<LINE>healthy Pokémon...?
Real Fishermen are impatient!<LINE>So we must battle immediately!
I lost!<LINE>It's the end!!
How do I know that real Fishermen<LINE>are so impatient?<LINE>Because we change places frantically<LINE>if we cannot catch Pokémon!
Kids! Please cooperate with the<LINE>physical therapy for me and my Pokémon!
My tackle was supposed to crush<LINE>even Rock-type Pokémon...
I was injured in a rough game, so<LINE>I am undergoing some physical therapy.
Join our team!<LINE>Actually, I will force you<LINE>to join our team!
Our team doesn't need a Trainer<LINE>who is quite that strong!
We are cooooool!<LINE>We hang out here every day!
If I win, give me your Pokémon!
That was just a joke.<LINE>You didn't have to take it so seriously!
Bah! I haven't fallen so low<LINE>that I would steal somebody's Pokémon<LINE><LINE>like Team Plasma!
Mua-ha-ha! I will leave here<LINE>for Victory Road.<LINE><LINE>It's my hobby to win against Trainers!
I can't believe this!
Rather than enjoying defeating someone,<LINE>should I aim higher...?<LINE>I guess the Pokémon League is the place<LINE>to find a better class of challengers.
Words are unnecessary!<LINE>I can understand everything if we battle.
...
Though people and Pokémon<LINE>cannot communicate with words,<LINE><LINE>we can communicate with our hearts!
I trained and trained like a madman,<LINE>and my Pokémon trained even more!
Yeah! Yeah!<LINE>Even though I lost, I'm energetic!
My Fighting-type Pokémon!<LINE>I train it to smash the challenge rock!
You are strong!<LINE>No, both you and your Pokémon are strong!
Extreme conditions<LINE>really test you and train you!
The wonderful combination<LINE>of you and your Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>What a beautiful friendship!
The pain of my Pokémon...<LINE>I feel it, too!
No! Not yet!<LINE>No! We can fight on!!
Aghhhh...<LINE>I did my best, but we lost...
I didn't see that coming.<LINE>You are a very difficult opponent.
Now is the moment of truth!<LINE>This really gets my blood pumping!
This intense feeling that floods<LINE>me after a defeat...<LINE><LINE>I don't know how to describe it.
Meow, meow, meow!<LINE>This sign means<LINE>have a battle with me!
Thank you for having a battle<LINE>with me!
Meow, meow, meow!<LINE>I am copying the Pokémon<LINE>I used to live with.
Victory Road!<LINE>I'll test myself by fighting against you<LINE>to see if I am ready to climb it!
Agh...<LINE>Was it too early for me?!
Victory Road!<LINE>It is really amazing!<LINE>That's the road to<LINE>the Pokémon League!
I'm a Hiker exploring caves.<LINE>I will teach you the harshness of life<LINE><LINE>and the difficulty of Pokémon battles.
Well...<LINE>Guess I'll take a hike.
In the caves...<LINE>Pokémon lurk in the piles of dirt!
Conquering a mountain means<LINE>conquering your fears!<LINE>Can you win against Pokémon<LINE>that have conquered many mountains?
You conquered a B-list mountain.<LINE>That B-lister is me!
Hikers aim at summits.<LINE>Pokémon Trainers aim<LINE>for the Pokémon League!
You need a Nurse's help?<LINE>Sure, if you can win against me,<LINE>I'll make your Pokémon healthy!
Come on!<LINE>Your team is really healthy!
OK! Then...<LINE>Time to give your Pokémon some energy!
It's wonderful that each Pokémon and<LINE>each person can do something special!<LINE>Me, I know how to make Pokémon healthy!
Welcome to the Battle Company!<LINE>Since you are here, battle with me.<LINE><LINE>I won't take no for an answer!
Oh, dear. Aren't you being<LINE>too hard on me?
In the Battle Company, the stronger you<LINE>are, the higher the floor you work on.
Hee hee! I am better at Pokémon battles<LINE>than I am at work!
I'm good at Pokémon, but I still lost!
A competent woman is<LINE>as good at Pokémon battles<LINE><LINE>as she is at her work!
Clay is at the bottom of the Gym,<LINE>but I will test you to see<LINE><LINE>whether you are skilled enough<LINE><LINE>to face the Gym Leader.
Agh, so frustrating!<LINE>Maybe I'm not skilled enough...
I started Pokémon battles<LINE>after I grew up,<LINE><LINE>but I got so into it!
Pouring rain... ♪<LINE>Fighting Pokémon... ♪
Ah, hear the sad melody<LINE>of a total defeat...
Rain is a wonderful melody<LINE>that nature plays! ♪
Water fun with Pokémon!<LINE>Do you want to play with us?
Uh-oh... I lost.<LINE>But it was fun, so I'm satisfied.
Aquatic sports with Pokémon!<LINE>Nothing is more fun than that!<LINE>It's 100% impossible to live<LINE>without Pokémon.
The splish-splosh sounds! Those were<LINE>your footsteps, weren't they?<LINE><LINE>So cute!
You are so strong--too strong to be cute!
According to footstep fortune-telling...<LINE>Those whose footsteps make a splish and<LINE>a splosh are Trainers that Pokémon like.
If you turn a parasol around,<LINE>it's like a flower blossoming in the rain!
Ack...<LINE>Come on!
On rainy days, use a parasol,<LINE>wear a coat, or get wet.<LINE><LINE>Do as you like!
I am a Rich Boy,<LINE>so I have a great Pokémon!
I am a Rich Boy. Even though I lost,<LINE>I'm not frustrated! Bah!
I am a Rich Boy. I will go on a shopping<LINE>spree to make myself feel better!
Even when I am resting from<LINE>too much shopping, I'm willing to battle!
Oh, no! I'm still the one to beat<LINE>in shopping competitions, though!
I'm very rich, but even I am<LINE>pleased with the selection<LINE><LINE>at this shopping mall. I want to buy more!
I will show you how energetic<LINE>I've become just by being here!
Naaatuuure!
If I use this, will my Pokémon<LINE>also become energetic?
When we are surrounded by green,<LINE>we feel more energetic. Don't you think?<LINE><LINE>Thank you, Mother Nature!
We are totally in sync!<LINE>Using our amazing connection,<LINE>I will teach you all about Rangers!
In fact, we learned<LINE>all about you!
Do you know much<LINE>about this Berry?
Listen carefully...<LINE>You may hear the sound<LINE>of breathing Pokémon and plants.
Mother Nature changes her look<LINE>according to the seasons...<LINE><LINE>That's something I cherish!
OK!<LINE>You seem to cherish nature!
When seasons change,<LINE>Mother Nature gives us this.
Nature changes,<LINE>and Pokémon evolve...<LINE>How can people change?
It takes 20 or even 30 years<LINE>for a tree to be fully grown!<LINE>Will you have a Pokémon battle<LINE>that pleases the trees?
I did my best...<LINE>I am satisfied!
This is what a tree gave me!
It's a slow business,<LINE>growing a tree.<LINE>No need to rush.<LINE>Raise strong Pokémon slowly.
I'll show you our style.<LINE>My Pokémon and nature are in harmony.
Wasn't our style worthy?
What do you let your Pokémon have?<LINE>What is their style?
First, we'll create our own style!<LINE>Because I am hopeless<LINE>at social niceties and fashions!
It blends in among the trees and grass,<LINE>and it shows its strength.<LINE><LINE>See the strength of my Pokémon!
What I wanted to see<LINE>was not YOUR strength...
This is what Pokémon love.<LINE>Here, take some!
There is nature and there are cities,<LINE>and it's lovely to have the choice.<LINE>Both people and Pokémon<LINE>can choose their favorite places!
Hm! You are an interesting case!<LINE>Please help me with my experiment!
Hm-hum! It's difficult to get a result<LINE>with this method.
When the wind blows, seeds fly.<LINE>When seeds fly, flowers bloom.<LINE>When the flowers bloom, we'll get seeds.<LINE>Everything is connected!
Just because I am a Scientist,<LINE>people think I am so serious!
Shocking! Nooooo waaaay!<LINE>I loooooost!
To turn a ridiculous idea<LINE>into a reality...<LINE>Science can make much more happen<LINE>than everyone thinks!
Oh! An unfamiliar face!<LINE>To help scientific progress,<LINE>please lend me a hand!
Instead of lending a hand,<LINE>you gave me a workout!
I don't know if science will make everyone<LINE>happy, but if I believe it will, that<LINE><LINE>helps me do my best. That's a fact.
I want to solve!<LINE>All the mysteries!<LINE>In the world!<LINE>For that purpose! I will keep fighting!
Whether I win or lose!<LINE>Mysteries only deepen!
I don't think I can solve<LINE>all mysteries by myself!<LINE>However! If I can discover something new<LINE>and help someone, I will be satisfied!
I've found a wonderful Trainer!<LINE>I will research you immediately!
The results of my research have revealed<LINE>that you are the best!
It is very exciting<LINE>to unlock the secrets<LINE><LINE>of Pokémon and their Trainers.
I love this place! The electricity<LINE>charges up my inspiration!
Aha!  <LINE>That made a light bulb go on in my head!
When a person moves,<LINE>electric signals travel in the body!<LINE>Also, when a person has an inspiration,<LINE>electric signals travel to the brain!
Pokémon and Poké Balls<LINE>are my real friends!<LINE>Join the training of<LINE>our Pokémon Eleven!
Aghhhhh! I must still be green!<LINE>I have plenty of guts, though!
Both my Pokémon and I<LINE>still haven't gotten enough practice...<LINE><LINE>In terms of levels, that would be five...
I am about to give a lecture<LINE>on the strength created by gathering<LINE><LINE>a proper balance of different Pokémon!
Bam! You lectured me!<LINE>What a great Trainer!
Team play with Pokémon<LINE>brought new fun to our sport.
My dad is working in a Gym!<LINE>I am receiving special training there!
...Dad.<LINE>...I couldn't win.
I have Pokémon battles with my dad, too.<LINE>My dad and I are quite evenly matched!
Workers carry Pokémon and loads.<LINE>I am a Youngster.<LINE>I am close to my Pokémon,<LINE>and we all cooperate happily!
Ummmm! You're closer<LINE>to your Pokémon than I am!
It never occurred to you that<LINE>the Pokémon you find around containers<LINE><LINE>came here from another place?
Sometimes you find more than just strong<LINE>Pokémon in the tall grass!
Strooooong!<LINE>What a Trainer!!
I will grow better and better<LINE>by fighting Pokémon in the tall grass!
Oh!<LINE>Ohhh?<LINE>What?! That's not a Pokémon,<LINE>just an ordinary Trainer!
You are not an ordinary Trainer.<LINE>You are a strong Trainer!!
Have you heard that when tall grass<LINE>waves in the breeze,<LINE><LINE>a rare Pokémon jumps out?
These are special Pokémon<LINE>I just caught!
I just caught them<LINE>and have not raised them yet!
OK! I will catch some different Pokémon<LINE>in Pinwheel Forest and have more friends!
OK! I'm brave and I'm bold!<LINE>Let's get right to the battle!
Pfft...<LINE>My bold bravery is vanishing into the air...
I will tell you 'cause you're strong!<LINE>Only one piece of the challenge rock<LINE>will be chipped off each day!
I wanted to captivate you,<LINE>but I feel like I slipped and fell!
I've seen a lot of Trainers!<LINE>You seem to have the same aura<LINE>that I felt from strong Trainers.
Exactly!<LINE>Your aura is exactly what I felt!
You have abundant kindness<LINE>as well as strength.
I'm the best around here.<LINE>Can you possibly be a match for me?
Your talent and sense...<LINE>Both are dazzling.
Perhaps the secret of your strength<LINE>is your commitment.
I am a Waiter who is good<LINE>at Pokémon battles.
Wonderful battle! A learning experience.<LINE>...Thanks for the tip!
Our specialty is the best<LINE>Pokémon battles.
Welcome!<LINE>Would you like a cold drink<LINE>with your Pokémon battle?
That was a wonderful battle.<LINE>Bravo!
Invigorating Soda Pop for exhausted<LINE>Pokémon after a battle!<LINE><LINE>Available in any vending machine!
Twist Mountain changes in every season,<LINE>and this old man changes in every battle!
Go easy on...<LINE>a grown-up?!
This old man likes winter.<LINE>Snow on Twist Mountain...<LINE>has an indescribable beauty.
My Pokémon love the ore mined here,<LINE>and they love fiery Pokémon battles!
You got me!<LINE>My Pokémon thinks so, too!
If Pokémon eat the ore inside a mountain,<LINE>a hole grows, and our work speeds up!<LINE>People and Pokémon<LINE>work great together!
The number two Trainer<LINE>on Twist Mountain is me!
From now on, you are the number two Trainer<LINE>on Twist Mountain.
From now on, I will be the<LINE>number three Trainer on Twist Mountain.<LINE>For your information,<LINE>the number one is Clay!
What do you think about the cannons?<LINE>Isn't it great that you can<LINE>experience how flying Pokémon feel?<LINE>Next, experience the feeling<LINE>of losing a Pokémon battle!
I was blown away!!
I'll be stronger if I fight<LINE>while thinking about Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>Victory will come my way!
Trainer! I bet you're<LINE>too blown away to fight!
What a calm person you are!<LINE>You're amazing!
Cannons used once may be used again.<LINE>It's recycling! Precisely!
In order to jump higher,<LINE>I am practicing really hard!
No problem! Even though I lost,<LINE>I will just prepare and jump again!
Trainer! Do you remember<LINE>what you were told at the beginning?<LINE>“The cannons go up, down,<LINE>left, and right.<LINE><LINE>You can enter them from anywhere!"<LINE>How about that?<LINE>I am good at imitating him, aren't I?
My plans are perfectly honed!<LINE>I cannot lose!
No way! What part of my fighting style<LINE>did I forget to double-check?
Check after check after check!<LINE>Complacency leads to accidents!
Battles in the Castelia Gym are<LINE>beautiful! They are pure art!!
Falling beautifully...<LINE>This is also an art...
If you step on two switches, two lamps<LINE>will light up and a gate will open!<LINE><LINE>This is also an art!
I like the feeling of walking<LINE>through the honey walls...<LINE><LINE>I've walked through them many times.
How is this possible?<LINE>I will walk through the honey walls again.
The honey walls...<LINE>What do you think they are made of?<LINE>Don't you think it is odd<LINE>that Burgh never tells us?
What do you think? This Pokémon Gym...<LINE>How should I say? Isn't it full of...<LINE><LINE>outrageous and mysterious charms?
As a Trainer,<LINE>you are full of charm!
I absolutely love this Gym where<LINE>Burgh's vision became reality!
I wasn't hiding under the floor<LINE>just to lose!
I was defeated by your strong spirit.<LINE>You seem unfazed by anything!
OK, challenger!<LINE>Bring it on!
But then, but...<LINE>I lost?!
Get on the elevators,<LINE>and go down and down!<LINE>A Trainer's spirit means<LINE>take it as far as you can!
When the elevator goes up,<LINE>my spirits rise!<LINE>When the elevator goes down,<LINE>my spirits fall...<LINE>If you want to know why Clay<LINE>is at the bottom, defeat me!
I lost. There go my spirits...<LINE>aaaaaall the way down!
Clay is waiting<LINE>at the very bottom because...<LINE>he wants to remember<LINE>that he was at the bottom in the past.
I face my Pokémon,<LINE>and we share our real feelings.<LINE>Sometimes that's what I do<LINE>in this Pokémon Gym.
Right now, my Pokémon and I<LINE>both feel the sting of defeat!
When we lose,<LINE>I apologize to my Pokémon...<LINE>It is important for our future,<LINE>and it helps me grow strong!
Wow! You are so strong!<LINE>Congratulations!
Here's my lame excuse:<LINE>I lost because the ship was swaying!






I thought I could take it easy against you,<LINE>but got burned bad!
While I was staring at your pretty face,<LINE>the Pokémon battle was over.
You know so many rare Pokémon!<LINE>Or at least, your Pokémon are new to me.
I... I am not disappointed.<LINE>Because I am elegant!
Dizzy...<LINE>So very dizzzzzy...
Having traveled the world, I realized<LINE>we can communicate through our Pokémon.
That message came through loud and clear!
Having traveled around the world,<LINE>I learned that travel brings change!<LINE>We should not be afraid of change.
Countless feelings infuse these ruins!<LINE>It's fun to imagine them!<LINE>And how are you feeling?
I am feeling...<LINE>very upset because I could not win!
People and Pokémon<LINE>each have different feelings.<LINE>And probably both are correct.
Being with my Pokémon makes me happy<LINE>even when we’re in a bad situation!
Yes! It was fun that your and my Pokémon<LINE>were both so energetic!
When I feel lonely at night,<LINE>I curl up with my Pokémon<LINE><LINE>and watch the twinkling stars.<LINE>I track the shooting stars<LINE>and slow down the rhythm of my life.
Whether I travel or not,<LINE>I want to make a great discovery.
Oh! I may have discovered<LINE>something good about you!
The world is full of mysteries!<LINE>That's why I look closely.<LINE>That's why I listen carefully.<LINE>I think, I reflect, and<LINE>I discover something new.
The Abilities of my Pokémon!<LINE>I will show them to you.
I could not make really good use<LINE>of the Ability Mummy...
If an Ability is changed to Mummy,<LINE>the Pokémon cannot use its original<LINE><LINE>Ability. It's subtly devious, isn't it?
Oh! That moment!<LINE>That's when we use Pokémon.
Oh! Is it over already?
Oh! That moment.<LINE>That's when you notice<LINE>how great Pokémon are!
I am a Psychic, so just one look at you<LINE>tells me that you are a Trainer!
I am a Psychic,<LINE>so I can tell the battle is over.
Sifting the ever-changing sands...<LINE>Sifting my ever-changing feelings...<LINE>Telepathy means others will be aware of<LINE>my feelings. That could be a good thing.<LINE>Wait! It means others will be aware when<LINE>I have awkward or painful feelings, too!
Let me battle with you!
Wow...<LINE>You are my strongest challenger so far.
Engage the switches and<LINE>start from the defined position.<LINE>If you try all the combinations,<LINE>someday you'll find the right one!
The problem is never<LINE>whether you can battle or not.<LINE><LINE>It's whether you will battle or not.
If you don't fight, you won't lose,<LINE>but you won't grow stronger, either.
When you're not sure if you'll succeed,<LINE>build momentum and take a leap!<LINE>It's fine! Because your Pokémon<LINE>are always with you!
The slippery frozen floor is perfect<LINE>for improving your sense of balance!
I slipped and lost!
Brycen slides on the frozen floor<LINE>all the time, so it's worn down, and<LINE><LINE>it looks like you can see the path...<LINE><LINE>but maybe I'm imagining it.
Well, well, if you are feeling dizzy<LINE>because of the Gym machines,<LINE><LINE>I will stand in your path!
Oh, dear me!
Being fired into the air by cannons<LINE>and spinning on the ice many times...<LINE><LINE>It's difficult to get Badges.
I always calm myself and choose<LINE>the critical moment in a battle.
Mmmm?! What?!<LINE>No way? Really?!
Being calm and having no emotion<LINE>are different.<LINE>Brycen rejoices quietly,<LINE>and he grows quietly in rage...
I am the King of Karate!!<LINE>I've taught my Pokémon moves<LINE>that they'll use in battle with you!
I am the King of Karate!!<LINE>I am skillful, but I lose quite often...
I am from a fighting dojo in Kanto!!<LINE>This is my global debut, so to speak!
Oh! Trainer!<LINE>Do you want to learn a bitter lesson?
The training is over!
Going slowly is fine.<LINE>If I train every single day,<LINE>I will be strong someday!
Are you looking for a Pokémon here,<LINE>or are you just taking a walk?<LINE><LINE>Either way, have a battle with me!
What is it?<LINE>I can't explain it, but you are great!
Even if you forget about this battle,<LINE>I will never forget this!
Competitive eating<LINE>is one thing I'm good at!
What I am bad at<LINE>is Pokémon battles...
I am training here to improve my<LINE>weak points.
Beginnings are important, whether<LINE>in a good novel or a good battle!
It seems this is the beginning<LINE>of my final chapter.
I feel we're about to turn the page<LINE>to the epilogue of this story.
Wow. I'm dumbstruck!<LINE>I know a lot of words, but right now I can't<LINE>figure out how to say this.<LINE>Perhaps, if the feeling I'm having now<LINE>is put into words, it will be trapped there.<LINE>So let me say this...<LINE>My feeling is you're a great Trainer!
I never thought you would use that move...<LINE>Not a bad choice at all.
Good, good...<LINE>But I will never retreat from any battle.
Even in this situation,<LINE>there must be a way to triumph!
If somebody wins a battle, then, without<LINE>doubt, someone else has lost the battle.<LINE>That's the way of battle.<LINE>A real warrior doesn't dash off in pursuit<LINE>of the next victory, nor throw a fit<LINE><LINE>when experiencing a loss.<LINE>A real warrior ponders the next battle.
Oh, so strong.<LINE>That makes my heart dance!
That's my final Pokémon!<LINE>So we'll use our last bit of strength!
Well, this may be the last.<LINE>I will put everything into my next move!
There is no single strongest Pokémon<LINE>or sole best combination...<LINE>That's why it is difficult<LINE>to keep winning.<LINE>However, I think a heart that desires<LINE>strength and strives to grow<LINE><LINE>stronger is a precious ideal.<LINE>That is why I respect you--<LINE>because you have these things.
I get the feeling a wonderful time<LINE>is about to start. I'm excited!
Even at a time like this,<LINE>I should stay cool and collected...
For the sake of the Pokémon<LINE>that believe in me, I will never give up.
As a Trainer, you are both excellent<LINE>and elegant. Your Pokémon have class.<LINE>I am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you believe that Pokémon battles<LINE>help us understand one another?
I will show you that my love for my friends<LINE>permeates every cell of my body. Behold!
My friends getting hurt...<LINE>That's what a Pokémon battle is.
Agggghh.<LINE>Every single time...
It's not fun to see<LINE>my friends in trouble.
Well, that's OK.<LINE>I was expecting this defeat.
Do you really think you can stop us<LINE>with that?
My last friend...<LINE>Please share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you--<LINE>and not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The truth I held...<LINE>The dreams Pokémon shared...
I was expecting exactly that kind of move!
What is going on here?
My calculations... No! My careful schemes!<LINE>The world should be mine!
I am a Doctor!<LINE>If you have Pokémon in bad shape...<LINE>Let me see your Pokémon in battle!
Your strength is fathomless!<LINE>I am deeply impressed.
Whether your Pokémon are healthy<LINE>or not, I'll restore them to full health!
I aim to be the best Doctor in the world!<LINE>But first, I intend to become<LINE>the best Trainer in the world!
An Ace Trainer like me has pride,<LINE>so I won't lose!
I could not protect my pride.<LINE>I'm mortified!
Pride does not mean acting arrogantly!<LINE>I'm really proud of what<LINE>I have achieved in my life!
I've thought about what I can do<LINE>to help my Pokémon win, and<LINE><LINE>finally I figured out the answer!
I'm afraid I could not read<LINE>what you wanted to do...
Read what your opponent wants to do.<LINE>Your opponent is human and may change<LINE>plans from moment to moment. Be careful!
Before going to the Pokémon League,<LINE>let me test my skills!
It's obvious, but there is always<LINE>someone better...
The Elite Four are said to be<LINE>waiting at the Pokémon League.<LINE><LINE>I wonder what kind of people they are.
Oh, boy...<LINE>My Pokémon want to brag about me.<LINE>So, let's start!
Ouch!<LINE>They can't brag about me.
Because I respect my opponents,<LINE>I want to win against them!<LINE>That's why I want other people to think<LINE>they want to win against me!
Whenever I am lost, I meet a Trainer!<LINE>Of course, we're gonna fight!
Mmmmm... It's not good<LINE>to fight when I am lost.
When people move ahead,<LINE>they get lost, or they stop...<LINE>At those moments, Pokémon give you<LINE>courage to keep moving forward!
The people who pass by here<LINE>have such different moods!<LINE>It's fun to watch, and even more fun<LINE>to fight against them!
Mwa haha!<LINE>It's fun!
Winning is good,<LINE>but winning is not everything...<LINE><LINE>Don't lose sight of what's important!
Wait! <LINE>You, young Trainer over there!<LINE>Look at my Pokémon.
Not bad!<LINE>I like your strength.
As a Pokémon grows, its connection<LINE>to its Trainer will improve,<LINE><LINE>and their bond becomes stronger!
If there is a steep cave in the east,<LINE>I go there and train my Pokémon, and<LINE><LINE>if there is a strong Trainer in the west,<LINE><LINE>I go there and challenge that Trainer!
My Pokémon clearly lack<LINE>proper training!!
Pokémon training Pokémon...<LINE>If they live in rugged wilderness,<LINE>that can happen naturally.
Oh, are you the legendary Pokémon<LINE>that is said to live here?
You startled me.<LINE>You are a person!
In the story I know,<LINE>the legendary Pokémon<LINE><LINE>was training its student Pokémon.
These Pokémon were born<LINE>on the same day and raised together!
Oh!<LINE>You're pretty good!
Our days with Pokémon<LINE>are full of happiness, and<LINE><LINE>our joys will grow as we live together!
Please tell me what kinds of Pokémon are<LINE>by your side and share your happiness<LINE><LINE>when you are happy!
Wow!<LINE>Wonderful!
When I've been happy or sad,<LINE>the Pokémon have always been with me.<LINE>I hope I can stay with them<LINE>as long as possible.
Celestial Tower means a perfect tower!<LINE>Oh, never mind.<LINE>Let's have a Pokémon battle.
You're really perfect!
I am far from perfect...
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and<LINE>Pokémon that grew up elsewhere--<LINE><LINE>both rest here quietly.
Your Pokémon are full of life!
Pokémon that grew up in Unova and<LINE>Pokémon that grew up elsewhere--<LINE><LINE>all are precious Pokémon...
I will guess what you are...<LINE>You are...<LINE>a Pokémon Trainer!
What was that?<LINE>I guessed what you were, though.
Everyone can make the effort<LINE>to understand their opponent.
The Dragon Gym in Opelucid City<LINE>is where tough Trainers show<LINE><LINE>they can carve out their own path!
I'm sure you can carve out<LINE>your own path!
As the name suggests,<LINE>a Gym Leader is the top of a Gym!<LINE>The Leader is top of the heap<LINE>at this Opelucid Gym!<LINE>If you want to meet the Leader,<LINE>climb up on the dragons' backs<LINE><LINE>and aim for the top floor!
Do you understand<LINE>how the dragons' heads move?
You're strong! I guess you want to know<LINE>about the dragons' heads pretty badly.
The dragons' arms go up and down...<LINE>And depending on the arms,<LINE>the dragons' heads turn right and left<LINE><LINE>and move up and down, too.<LINE>Listen! Here is a hint!<LINE>If both arms point down,<LINE>the dragon's head sinks down, too.
I will test you to see how well<LINE>you really know Pokémon!
You are bringing out your Pokémon's<LINE>full potential!
I am a Trainer. <LINE>I don't have to get strong myself.<LINE>All I have to do is to support Pokémon<LINE>so that they can fight at their best.
By any chance,<LINE>are you unsure of what to do?
What is this?<LINE>I felt your confidence.
The dragons in this Gym<LINE>can be elevators, too!
I will tell a Trainer who beats me<LINE>how to move forward in this Gym!
Wow! <LINE>You beat me!
Jump from a triangle mark!<LINE>When you land on a switch on an arm,<LINE>the dragon's head will move,<LINE><LINE>and you can move ahead!
Are you happy just hanging out<LINE>with Pokémon?<LINE><LINE>Or do they have to be strong?<LINE><LINE>We'll see which type you are!
Your Pokémon seem to be happy<LINE>just hanging around with you!
Every person loves Pokémon<LINE>in a different way.<LINE>Getting strong with my Pokémon...<LINE>That's the way I chose.
I wonder what you will do<LINE>as a Trainer?!
Oh, you fight very well.<LINE>You are great!
I love Pokémon battles!<LINE>I never know what my opponent will do.<LINE>It gives me chills!<LINE>Win or lose, it's the excitement<LINE>of the fight that counts!
My favorite word is “challenge"!<LINE>Do you like challenges?
You seem to like challenges!
Do you like challenges...?<LINE>If you take a challenge,<LINE>you can find something good.<LINE>If you don't try anything, you just<LINE>make excuses.
Argh...<LINE>My heart aches!
We have ten years' experience battling!<LINE>I give you a taste of a Veteran's skill!
I guess the time spent<LINE>is not everything!
Getting stronger...<LINE>is like walking down a road<LINE>that never ends,<LINE><LINE>no matter how much you fight...<LINE>It's what this Dragon Gym is about.<LINE>It's the secret of the dragons' backs...
I've heard about you.<LINE>I heard you work Pokémon hard!
Yes, I heard you are strong.<LINE>You match what I heard exactly.
To get to a lower level, stand still<LINE>in the midst of quicksand.<LINE>I'm not being kind...<LINE>My companions will defeat you.
You!<LINE>To please my Pokémon, lose!
What a Trainer!
Because of you,<LINE>my Pokémon lost!<LINE><LINE>Don't you feel sorry for them?<LINE>Besides, you are just depending<LINE>on your Pokémon for strength.
If everyone frees their Pokémon,<LINE>there is no winning or losing!
If I don't have Pokémon,<LINE>I won't lose like this!
How dare you interrupt us<LINE>without understanding us?
We fight for the young king...<LINE>That's it!
My king...<LINE>I am so sorry.
Everything changes.<LINE>Unova will also be born again.<LINE><LINE>Why don't you admit that?
You can't change the world<LINE>without a little pain!
Ouch...<LINE>I don't like pain.
We're trying so hard to change the world<LINE>because nobody else is trying. Yet...<LINE>That's right! You! Can you understand<LINE>our lord N's feelings?
Pokémon are too good for the likes of<LINE>you! They are amazing, but putting them<LINE><LINE>in the hands of foolish Trainers can bring<LINE><LINE>nothing good!
Argh!<LINE>Annoying!
Me, lose? Here I am, covered in sand,<LINE>throwing everything I have into it,<LINE><LINE>and I lose? Am I that much of a loser?<LINE>It should be your loss.<LINE>And that's an order!
I won't tolerate people<LINE>who have different ideas!
Argh...<LINE>I won't forgive you!
I repeat! We won't tolerate people<LINE>who have different ideas!<LINE>Your friends are waiting below--<LINE>now get out!
When I am surrounded by rocks,<LINE>my spirit goes up!!
When I lose,<LINE>my spirits sink...
My spirits rise and fall.<LINE>I'm just charmingly unpredictable!
Why do I dig?<LINE>Why do you fight?<LINE><LINE>Let's find out.
Your past experience...<LINE>Is that the source of your strength?
The more you fight,  <LINE>the stronger you'll be.<LINE>The more you dig, <LINE>the bigger the hole will be...<LINE>If you have a purpose, <LINE>there's no wasted effort!
At work, we do our best.<LINE>That is my, and my Pokémon's, way of life!
We did our best,<LINE>and this is the result?!
Well, well, I guess I'll go back to work.<LINE>'Cause my precious Pokémon<LINE>are better at work.
My favorite things are:<LINE>Mountains! Meals! Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>And fun battles!!
Oh, ho ho!<LINE>You got me!
Your team is so strong!<LINE>But my Pokémon were also<LINE>quite good, weren't they?
I'm chasing my dream,<LINE>and I'm fighting for a victory!
I can't catch that dream!
I am looking for a legendary Pokémon<LINE>said to be hiding in this cave.<LINE>Yes, it's true. Men are suckers for<LINE>adventure, no matter how old we get!
This cave is full of rocks<LINE>generating electricity!<LINE><LINE>The electricity is charging me up!
Yowch, a lightning spark!
The sources of my energy are<LINE>my precious Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>This has been scientifically proven!!
I will research and investigate<LINE>your Pokémon!
I must analyze my defeat...
Why don't you go discover<LINE>something else?
I will unlock the mechanism<LINE>and find the secret of your power!
I was so preoccupied with the mechanism,<LINE>I forgot to concentrate on the battle!
The mechanism of rain, and<LINE>the science of changing seasons...<LINE><LINE>Nature is full of wonders.
I see.<LINE>I'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...<LINE>It's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.<LINE>I'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...<LINE>It's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
I see.<LINE>I'm surprised you chose that move.
Mind you...<LINE>It's not over yet!
Well! You are strong, as usual!
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>Wahhhhh!
Long live Team Plasma!
For every great plan, there<LINE>is someone to get in the way.
Have you learned your lesson now?<LINE>...I'm such a sore loser.
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>Ahh, our beautiful dream...
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>This is a nightmare!
Whoa, whoa, come on now!<LINE>I'm shocked to lose against a little kid!
It's best to use what you have learned<LINE>in order to master it!
What can you learn by losing?<LINE>I feel like there's a “Eureka!" here for me.
I'm mastering the lesson in three<LINE>dimensions by experiencing it like this!
Come on! <LINE>You're just a kid--a kid on an ego trip!
Our rules and your rules<LINE>are different!
Plasmaaaa! If this keeps up,<LINE>we won't save the Pokémon!
My hunch is you're sabotaging us because<LINE>you're flat-out jealous of our cool outfits.
You seem to understand the importance<LINE>of the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,<LINE>I can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.<LINE>But why can't I win?!
You seem to understand the importance<LINE>of the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,<LINE>I can still pull this off and win.

You seem to understand the importance<LINE>of the first attack very well.
If I can bring out the power of my Pokémon,<LINE>I can still pull this off and win.
Impressive.<LINE>But why can't I win?!
Well, at a time like this,<LINE>let's have a Pokémon battle!
I see. <LINE>Was that your favorite Pokémon?
Wherever I go in the world,<LINE>I have Pokémon battles!<LINE>Once I ask about someone's favorite<LINE>Pokémon, we soon become friends!
My way of life is dynamic!
My way of losing is<LINE>also dynamic!
My Pokémon are always with me!<LINE>That's why I can be dynamic!

...What?
Pah, is that it?<LINE>I lost before I knew it...
Oh, hee hee hee...<LINE>You're so strong.
Pant, pant, pant, pant...



The ideal movement of living things,<LINE>such pure beauty!<LINE>Ah, let me behold them!
I saw their beauty up close!
You know, creatures that exert <LINE>all their strength are always beautiful.
If you win against me,<LINE>I will give you something good<LINE><LINE>from this backpack!
You are great!<LINE>And strong!
Here you are.<LINE>I will give you this as I promised!
It feels great to run as fast as you can<LINE>over mountains and through forests.<LINE><LINE>Right?
I came here on my journey,<LINE>but it's kind of lively here, isn't it?
Is there a festival or something <LINE>going on here?
This is what I found during my trip.<LINE>I don't need it, so I will give it to you.
Everybody is dressed the same way.<LINE>Is this some kind of ceremony?
I bet athletes are not satisfied<LINE>with their games.<LINE>That's how I feel<LINE>when I watch them.<LINE>The reason? If you win against me,<LINE>I will tell you why!
Are you pleased with your victory?<LINE>Or are you unsatisfied?
This Moomoo Milk is tasty<LINE>and so very satisfying!
No matter how great their play is,<LINE>there is always a greater play.<LINE>I am never satisfied with my bread,<LINE>even though I bake it very well.<LINE>I always want to make the next<LINE>loaf even more delicious!
A place where you can warm up!<LINE>That's what I heard and why I came here!<LINE><LINE>Let's turn up the heat on this thing!
The heat here is too much.<LINE>I'm just burning up!
My warrior's heart is burning!<LINE>Thank you for the hot battle!<LINE>Next, I will stay on this hot streak<LINE>and watch the game!
To raise healthy Pokémon, you need<LINE>to keep their minds and bodies active,<LINE><LINE>watching games and having battles!
It's so frustrating to lose!<LINE>But it's also important to learn from it.
You learn more when you lose<LINE>than when you win!<LINE><LINE>I think it's the same for sports, too.
The Pokémon I raised are<LINE>as good as professionals!
The Pokémon you raised<LINE>are great, too!
There are so many ways<LINE>to raise Pokémon.
I am not skipping work!
If I had known this would happen,<LINE>I would have worked diligently.
Taking a productive break<LINE>is also part of any job!
Someone sent me a ticket, so I came.<LINE>But there's no game going on!
I have a lot of work to do.<LINE>What am I doing here?
Athletes on off days are no better<LINE>than guys on days off.
I wonder if there are great children<LINE>who will become stars someday<LINE><LINE>who are now just kids at my preschool.
You are also quite brilliant, but<LINE>real stars are cool.
You seem to have potential as a star.<LINE>So, will you please be my friend?
Should I get autographs now<LINE>from children who are likely to be stars?
I love sports and Pokémon most of all.<LINE>How about a battle?<LINE>They used to call me the Cleaner!
I could not stop all<LINE>of your Pokémon's attacks...
I used to be a Striker.<LINE>I was responsible for scoring goals.<LINE>Now I am a sweeper.<LINE>I am responsible for sweeping floors.
The athletes' Pokémon are great!<LINE>But my Pokémon are also great!
Your Pokémon are also great!
I will strive to raise my Pokémon<LINE>to that level!
Did you see today's game?!<LINE>There was some great ball handling<LINE>by players and Pokémon!<LINE>The excitement is pumping me up<LINE>for a battle!
I lost, but I am still excited!
The only place you can watch Pokémon<LINE>enjoying sports is Nimbasa City!
When I come here, I get hyper!<LINE>So, let's have a battle right away!
I lost against you too quickly!
When I am watching a game, I get hyper!<LINE>I just can't sit still!
Doctor! Is there a Doctor<LINE>in the audience?<LINE>Yes, I am a Doctor.<LINE>Let's get into a battle.
Oh! My Pokémon is all worn out!
When Pokémon lose energy, Max Revive!<LINE>You should also take one with you.
When I am watching a game,<LINE>I just keep worrying about<LINE><LINE>whether an athlete will be injured.
You chose to speak to me from<LINE>among so many people!<LINE><LINE>You have a good eye!
You are a worthy opponent!
The way you use moves...<LINE>Quite honestly, I like it!<LINE>Here, this is for you!
Heehee.<LINE>Even when I am in the crowd,<LINE>people can tell I am strong.
I usually act like an Ace Trainer,<LINE>but I want to be an ordinary girl,<LINE><LINE>at least when I am here.
I don't want to think about Pokémon<LINE>very much right now!
If I give you this,<LINE>will you leave me alone?
Even as an Ace Trainer, sometimes<LINE>I just want to be an ordinary girl!<LINE>I want to scream for the cool athletes,<LINE>and enjoy my time.
Which team will score next?!<LINE>If you can win, I will tell you!
Aha!<LINE>That team will score next!
My psychic power only works<LINE>right before a player scores a point.
Heheh...<LINE>The team I want to win<LINE>always wins!
What...? Was everything up till now<LINE>just a coincidence...?
Feelings matter when you cheer!<LINE>If I believe, I feel my team will win!
Fishing is a perfectly respectable sport!<LINE>Why isn't there a fishing stadium?!
...Of course, fishing is fun<LINE>when you enjoy it in nature.
I like quiet nature,<LINE>but I like lively places like this, too.
A lot of sports started<LINE>as Gentlemen's games!
Ladies and Gentlemen!<LINE>The game is over!
Because I am a Gentleman,<LINE>I will present you with this gift.
Pokémon battles were born spontaneously<LINE>when people and Pokémon<LINE><LINE>first became friendly.
Hey, hey, did you see that? Awesome!<LINE>A lot of famous people from TV are here!
Athletes are all coooool.<LINE>I want to be like them.
Aghhhhh. Why didn't I bring a camera,<LINE>or a notebook for an autograph?
Sports and juggling are the same.<LINE>You must entertain the audience!<LINE><LINE>I will show you the fruits of my practice.
While I am having a Pokémon battle,<LINE>I catch ten balls!
I have mastered the technique,<LINE>but I cannot use it!<LINE><LINE>I just have to have real battles!
That incredibly flashy dorm,<LINE>and squealing cheerleaders all around...<LINE>Grrr...<LINE>I am envious!
What is so great about popular athletes?<LINE>What is bad about martial artists?
A run-down dojo, and a lot of shouts like<LINE>hai-ya and kee-up...<LINE>If I had known this before, I would have<LINE>been a different kind of athlete.
When I grow up,<LINE>I will be a pro athlete!
Waaaaah!<LINE>I will never give you my autograph!
I will practice my autograph<LINE>for when I go pro!
My daddy is<LINE>an athlete here!
Waaaaaah. Dadddddddy.
...I won't cry.<LINE>'Cause I promised my daddy.
Even Socialites enjoy sports,<LINE>in a very elegant way!<LINE>A Pokémon battle is<LINE>a sport in a way!<LINE><LINE>Let's fight elegantly!
O-ho-ho!<LINE>I lost so elegantly.
Oh dear, I mistook this for a ball<LINE>and ordered it. Now it's yours.
First of all, we should enjoy<LINE>sports and Pokémon battles!<LINE>If you get hung up on winning and losing,<LINE>you lose sight of what is most valuable.
I will be strong in Pokémon battles,<LINE>and I will marry a professional athlete!
Ah.<LINE>I still have a long way to go!
Your Pokémon are strong. I will give<LINE>something good to a strong person!
Strong people are always totally<LINE>attractive. Don't you think?
A Hiker, an athlete,<LINE>and a Pokémon Trainer.<LINE><LINE>Do you know what is important?
Grrrrrrr!<LINE>Clearly you know it!
Prepare thoroughly. <LINE>If you don't, you can't do anything!
I can't believe nobody has noticed me...<LINE>I am a star!
Don't look at me. I lost!
Whose autograph do you want?<LINE>Don't you want one of mine?
You are energetic!<LINE>I will punish lazy children!
You just don't quit!<LINE>You are so energetic!
OK! An energetic Trainer!<LINE>Take this!
Nurses need plenty of stamina,<LINE>both day and night!
My darling is working here.<LINE>How about that? Are you envious?
My darling is seriously the best.<LINE>He puts athletes to shame.
My darling is a Janitor!<LINE>He cleans this entire big place<LINE><LINE>by himself every day. Cool, huh?<LINE><LINE>Nobody else can do what he does.
Games in the rain look extra tough,<LINE>don't they?<LINE>I wonder what Pokémon battles<LINE>in rain are like.
Well, this place is indoors,<LINE>so they don't get rained out.
If a stadium has a roof, <LINE>they can play a game anytime!
Hey! It's me! It's me!<LINE>I am the best Pilot in Unova!
You! You are daring!<LINE>Be my apprentice!
A once-in-a-lifetime flight!<LINE>Fly, fly, and fly away!
Do you want to know<LINE>how the VIP seats are?<LINE>I will tell you<LINE>if you win against me!
VIP seats are very far away<LINE>from the athletes!
I could see the game fine, but<LINE>the athletes looked like grains of rice.
You!<LINE>You are a fan of that person.<LINE>I can tell!<LINE>But that person is mine!
Oh no, oh why?<LINE>I am sorry...
Come to think of it,<LINE>the more supporters there are,<LINE><LINE>the better.<LINE>You! Cheer until you lose your voice,<LINE>and clap until your hands fall off!
When I am watching a game,<LINE>I feel like I should be moving, too!
That was a good workout!
The dorm is fine, but I want to play<LINE>sports outdoors.
I want to drag people here<LINE>and have them enlist as Pokémon Rangers.
Wow! Electrifying!<LINE>You are so goooood!
You! Be a Pokémon Ranger!<LINE>I will give you a good workout!
Watch a game during a study break!<LINE>Have a battle during a game break!
Gah!<LINE>This is so not relaxing!
When I come here for fun,<LINE>I can study more efficiently!
OK, I decided!<LINE>If I win against you,<LINE><LINE>I will be a Gym Leader!
Ummmm...<LINE>Maybe I'm not ready to be a Gym Leader?
I have to consider what I will be<LINE>by trying a lot of things!
I wonder if being good at sports<LINE>and being good at battles are related?
It was very helpful...
Ummmm. You are<LINE>quite interesting.<LINE>Please have this!
Both sports and Pokémon are<LINE>like a science for me!
I am stuck inside the lab,<LINE>with a medicinal smell every day,<LINE><LINE>and then I get stressed out.
Waaaaaahhh! Frustrating!
Breaking out made me feel better!<LINE>Here's a token of my appreciation.
Let's have another Pokémon battle<LINE>sometime, so we won't be stressed out!
These are not shorts!<LINE>These are half pants!
You were so strong that<LINE>my half pants almost fell down!
You are awesome!<LINE>Here's an awesome gift for you!
I envy basketball players.<LINE>'Cause they wear shorts, not half pants.<LINE>But baseball and football<LINE>uniforms are also cool!
Mmm!<LINE>You smell like an athlete!
I see. That is the smell<LINE>that strong people give off...
You seem to be getting even stronger...<LINE>OK. Please take this.
I hope you will get even stronger<LINE>by using it.
Wow, you have a lot of Badges.<LINE>Let me see your skills!
That fighting style reminds me<LINE>of the old days!
A person like you should use<LINE>top-shelf items--like this!
No matter how old we get,<LINE>let's stay Trainers!
Cheering makes us<LINE>thirsty. Right?<LINE>If you can win against me,<LINE>I'll give you a drink!
The battle made me<LINE>even thirstier!
Here you are.<LINE>I will give you something good!
At a place like this,<LINE>it's good to drink a lot of water!
Cheering makes us<LINE>thirsty. Right?<LINE>If you can win against me,<LINE>I'll give you a drink!
The battle made me<LINE>even thirstier!
Here you are.<LINE>I will give you something good!
At a place like this,<LINE>it's good to drink a lot of water!
Let's have a battle on these grounds,<LINE>which I keep looking sharp!
The best battle<LINE>on the best ground!
OK! I will keep the grounds<LINE>looking perfect!
This air of excitement brings back<LINE>memories. In those days, I was also...
It makes my old wound ache...
I may not look like it,<LINE>but I used to be quite an athlete.
Are you a criminal?!
Oh, you are not a criminal...<LINE>Sorry! Lo siento!
I'm here because I heard someone<LINE>around here was faking points.
What? A battle at a place like this?<LINE>Wait! Everybody is watching us!
Well, thanks to you, <LINE>I overcame my stage fright.
What? Nobody is watching me?<LINE>Nooooo. Look at me, please!
I want you to tell me something!
You showed me your full strength!
I will work at the Battle Subway<LINE>from now on, but...<LINE><LINE>where is it?
I want to play tennis<LINE>like a strong athlete!
Joe: A no-point game<LINE>against you 'cause you're strong...<LINE>Ross: A no-point game<LINE>'cause we could not win at all!
I want to be as good a Cyclist<LINE>as a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?<LINE>Then, we cannot have a battle.
I want to play ball<LINE>like a strong athlete!

I want to learn more from<LINE>a strong person like you...
Only one Pokémon?<LINE>I prefer a doubles match.
Whoosh! Whoosh!<LINE>I can fight like that!
Joe: Fffffft...<LINE>Fffffft, fffffft... The ball needs air.<LINE>Ross: Faaaault!<LINE>I missed a serve!
They can keep moving<LINE>for such a long time.<LINE>Smashers are really great!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hah!<LINE>Did you see my power serve?<LINE>And my Pokémon is<LINE>even stronger!

The person who controls his serves<LINE>controls the game.<LINE><LINE>I will practice my serves a bit more.
Hah!
I love to watch professionals play!<LINE>Yaaaay! I won't lose, either!
Ai: What?<LINE>Did we lose...?<LINE>Ciel: Ouch... I knew watching a game and<LINE>playing it are different!
Watching a professional game<LINE>makes me strangely confident!
Exciting!
I want to move elegantly, too!<LINE>Hey! Have a battle with me!

When professionals are playing,<LINE>it looks so easy...
Thrilling!
Oh!<LINE>Athletes are looking over this way!<LINE>Let's have a battle to impress them.
Masa: Agghhh!<LINE>We showed them an embarrassing scene.<LINE>Yas: Hurrah! Hurrah!<LINE>My Pokémon! What...?
I thought they were looking at us, but<LINE>they were looking at their opponents...
Is that athlete looking at me?<LINE>No, he's not.
If I win in a Pokémon battle,<LINE>cheer for this team.

I lost, so I will cheer for you!<LINE>Hurray! Hurray! Go you go!<LINE>Hustle! Hustle! Go you go!
Ummmm. The cheering for this team<LINE>is not nearly loud enough...
Look at this buff body!<LINE>And the Pokémon that support it!<LINE>Let's have a Pokémon battle<LINE>to show off my greatness!
Masa: The greatness of basketball...<LINE>I think you got it.<LINE>Yas: Shall we curl up <LINE>like balls?
The important thing in basketball<LINE>is outstanding teamwork!
Hmph! Hmph!<LINE>First-class athletes <LINE>speak with their backs.
The way the athletes scramble<LINE>for that ball...<LINE>I wish they'd fight over me that way!

From the ball's point of view,<LINE>it's like, please don't fight over me!
The way the athletes scramble<LINE>for that ball...<LINE>I wish they'd fight over me that way!
If you win, I will tell you<LINE>why I like basketball!
Kat: Come on!<LINE>Phae: Look! Even though we lost, <LINE>the ball is still spinning!
When you are watching basketball,<LINE>it reminds you of fruit in a basket,<LINE><LINE>and it looks delicious. Right?
Basketball... No, no. For a battle, <LINE>you need to have two Pokémon.
My special skill is that I can<LINE>spin a ball on my finger.<LINE><LINE>I can spin it forever!

I want to have Poké Balls<LINE>with the same designs as<LINE><LINE>the balls used in sports!
Basketball... No, no. For a battle,<LINE>you need to have two Pokémon.
Look!<LINE>My defense is magnificent!
Hawk: It's strange. When professionals<LINE>are playing, it looks so easy...<LINE>Dar: I guess we cannot play<LINE>quite as well as the professionals...
Rock-solid defense!<LINE>That's a real thrill in football!
DE-fense! DE-fense!
Look!<LINE>My magnificent offense!

Offense that smashes in every direction!<LINE>That's a real thrill in football!
Offffffense!
The bond of football fans<LINE>is stronger than any tackle!
Hawk: The bond between you and<LINE>your Pokémon is strong, too!<LINE>Dar: This feeling will go well past<LINE>the goal line...
Football is knockdown amazing,<LINE>because you can feel the excitement,<LINE><LINE>the bond between players and the crowd!
Our bond as fans<LINE>is way stronger than this!
My cheer will go over the goal line<LINE>and will be heard for a million miles!

When I cheer for my team<LINE>until I get thirsty,<LINE><LINE>Fresh Water tastes even better!
Come on! Cheer louder!<LINE>Yell! Yell!
I mainly play on offense.<LINE>My friend is mainly defense.<LINE>I will show you the teamwork<LINE>of football fans!
Cam: The teamwork of your Pokémon<LINE>is outstanding!<LINE>Abby: I'm super impressed!
If what you want to do is different<LINE>from what your partner wants to do,<LINE><LINE>it's hard to win a Double Battle!
You know, football is a team sport!<LINE>Please prepare at least two Pokémon!
Double Battles!<LINE>This is the best way to feel<LINE>the heat of the game of football!

The right play can turn a game around...<LINE>Pokémon battles are the same, too!
Double Battles!<LINE>You need at least two Pokémon<LINE>to feel the heat of the game of football!
Boom-boom-badum! Ha! Boom-boom-badum!<LINE>Listen to the fans' drumbeat!
Les: Thank you for listening to the beat<LINE>of our spirit!<LINE>Web: Thank you for listening to the yell<LINE>of our spirit!
Ha, pan-pan-papan, hey-hoo!!<LINE>Next, we will use this rhythm!
Bam-bam-bam! Ha! Bam-bam-bam!<LINE>I see the end coming?
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo Ta-raaa!<LINE>Listen to the fans shout!

Pan, pan-papan, hey-oo!! Right?<LINE>Oh, the rhythm is wonderful!
Beep-beep-beep! Ha! Ta-roo ta-raaa!<LINE>Listen to the fans shout!
Olé, olé, oléeee!<LINE>This is the fan song I wrote!<LINE>The Pokémon listening to this song<LINE>try harder than usual!
Kay: Olé, olé...<LINE>Huh? It's over.<LINE>Ali: You are very strong!
“Olé!" means<LINE>“Go!" or “Move forward!"
Olé, olé, oléeee!<LINE>I am cheering now!<LINE>If you have two Pokémon,<LINE>I don't mind battling with you!
My friend came here with me...<LINE>She comes 'cause she wants to sing<LINE><LINE>more than cheering for the team.

I am a fan of all the players<LINE>who are doing their best!<LINE><LINE>So, I want both teams to win!
With only one Pokémon,<LINE>it's a bit hard to battle.
Hey, you!<LINE>Do you know what offside means?
Kay: What we just saw is offside!<LINE>I bet it's offside!<LINE>Ali: B... Baaaaah!<LINE>I won't tell you anymore!
What? What is offside?<LINE>Er... The girl next to me knows!
Off!
Hey, shall I tell you<LINE>about the offside penalty?

Offside is when...<LINE>Er... The girl next to me will explain!
Side!
The bases loaded with two outs<LINE>in the bottom of the ninth inning...<LINE><LINE>After that... Isn't that obvious?
Alf: Strike!<LINE>Game over! Yes, the end!<LINE>Fred: Ah, my Poké Ball!
A game-winning homer...<LINE>We always hope for that clutch play!
Striiiiike!!
I don't have a home-run ball,<LINE>but I do have a Poké Ball!

I wish I could catch a home-run ball<LINE>just once!
Ball!
Hit a home run!
Ami: We're slammed.<LINE>Eira: I'm going home.
Elesa's fashion sense<LINE>is funky, too.
A one-on-two battle is<LINE>too funky!
Hey, what does “long ball" mean?

What I heard is<LINE>it means a home run.<LINE>“Homer" also<LINE>means a home run!
We two battle together, so<LINE>you need two Pokémon!
Hey, you!<LINE>Don't smile at my favorite player.
Ami: Argh! We lost,<LINE>and it's your fault.<LINE>Eira: You should try harder.<LINE>Don't drag me down.
The only thing we have in common<LINE>is that we like the same team.<LINE>But really, isn't that the most<LINE>important thing for a fan?
Argh, because of you, <LINE>we're in a big pinch.
Argh, annoying!<LINE>It's none of your business<LINE>who I cheer for.

Our teamwork is sooooo bad,<LINE>except when we cheer during games.<LINE>But we really don't care<LINE>about any time but game time.
No way! Argh, we are losing<LINE>because you are not really trying!
I am quite strong.<LINE>I will work out today, too!
I... I got worked over.
Your strength!<LINE>You pack quite a punch!
POWER!!<LINE>If you have power that nobody can beat,<LINE>you can win both Pokémon battles<LINE><LINE>and football games!
I...still don't have enough power?
Mmmm... Maybe I should<LINE>train more...
Pokémon and Poké Balls<LINE>are my real friends!<LINE>Join the training of<LINE>our Pokémon Eleven!
Aghhhhh! I am still such a rookie!<LINE>But I have more guts than anybody else!
My Pokémon and I still haven't<LINE>practiced enough...<LINE>To put it in levels, we're maybe a ten...
I am stronger than ever.<LINE>I will work out today, too!!
I got worked over.
A swing and a miss...<LINE>I can't keep up with your strength!
POWER!!!<LINE>With my ripped muscles,<LINE>I will overcome everything!
I still don't have<LINE>enough muscles...?!
Maybe I should change<LINE>my training regimen...
Pokémon and Poké Balls<LINE>are my real friends!<LINE>Please join the training of<LINE>our Pokémon Eleven!
Aghhhhh! I'm still such a rookie!<LINE>I have more than enough guts, though!
My Pokémon and I<LINE>still haven't practiced enough...<LINE><LINE>To put it in levels, we're about a 20...
I am the strongest.<LINE>I will work out today, too!!
I...got worked over!
Your strength is<LINE>home-run class!
POWER!!!!<LINE>I will win! My superior power<LINE>can blaze any trail!
Is it possible that just having power<LINE>is not enough...?
Football games and Pokémon battles<LINE>both require power and technique.
Pokémon and Poké Balls<LINE>are my real friends!<LINE>Please join the training of<LINE>our Pokémon Eleven!
Aghhhhh! I am such a rookie!<LINE>I've got more guts, though!
My Pokémon and I still<LINE>haven't practiced enough...<LINE><LINE>To put it in levels, we're maybe a 50...
I've practiced and practiced<LINE>and become a great player!<LINE><LINE>Now, let's play ball!
Game over!
Now, practice, practice, practice!<LINE>Practicing over and over is the best way<LINE>to be good at anything!<LINE>My hard work will make me a great player!
Kids! Please cooperate with the<LINE>special training for my Pokémon!
My block was supposed to guard<LINE>against even Steel-type Pokémon...
Physical therapy is over,<LINE>so we're doing some special training.
Let me tell you about the strength<LINE>of the team you create when<LINE><LINE>you put a strong Pokémon at the core.
...You taught me!<LINE>You are great!
It looks like a team built around<LINE>a strong Pokémon. That is, an ace<LINE><LINE>has advantages and disadvantages.
Together, my Pokémon and I<LINE>are the world's strongest!!
Wow! I didn't think anyone could<LINE>catch my blazing fastball!
My fastballs are so fast,<LINE>nobody can hit them.<LINE>Very few can catch my fastballs<LINE>except Pokémon.
I, I...<LINE>I'm not fat, am I?
Ripped!
I am ripped!<LINE>I am not fat.
I have great footwork with the ball.<LINE>Poké Balls, too. See?
After I let Pokémon out of<LINE>Poké Balls... Well, I am still practicing...
I should practice more<LINE>on Pokémon handling, too.
I play occasionally,<LINE>but I want to become a better player!<LINE>So I will fight<LINE>a lot of Pokémon battles, too!
UGHH!<LINE>I couldn't even pass the ball!
I will do anything to play better!<LINE>It's over if you get complacent!
An elegant Smasher<LINE>has an elegant battle!
E-e-e-even though I lost,<LINE>I will not panic.
Because I am a lady, I won't be,<LINE>well, you know,<LINE><LINE>ch-ch-chagrined at losing.<LINE><LINE>Well, maybe a teensy little bit.
I am in the starting lineup now,<LINE>but I will be even better soon!<LINE>I will practice with a lot<LINE>of Pokémon battles!
UGHH!<LINE>My field positioning was terrible!
If I think about why I made a mistake<LINE>and correct it, I'll make fewer mistakes.<LINE>And if I work to improve my strength,<LINE>I'll get even stronger!
As a proper lady, I am elegant<LINE>all the way down to my toes!
Wahhhhh! What is this??
Oh! I am a lady,<LINE>yet I have lost my nerve...
I've always played games,<LINE>but now I want to be the best player!<LINE>I will practice with a lot of<LINE>Pokémon battles!
UGHH! I missed the goal!<LINE>I was blocked!!
I won't give up games!<LINE>I won't accept limits!<LINE>Nobody can stop me<LINE>as long as I want to improve!
I am a lady. I will challenge others<LINE>to battle elegantly!
You should...<LINE>Go easy on me!
B-b-b-because I am a lady...<LINE>waaaah...<LINE><LINE>I will admit my defeat gracefully...
No matter how much I sweat,<LINE>I won't smell sweaty!
A healthy sweat...<LINE>Boy, I am glad that I am an athlete!
After a battle, take a bath!<LINE>After eating, brush your teeth!
The world championships are coming soon!<LINE>I will practice volleys<LINE><LINE>by using you as a wall!
Whoa! Lemme...catch...my breath...<LINE>That was some good training...
You and I have just met.<LINE>Let's start the game from the beginning!
Hey! Trainer!<LINE>I will strike you from above.<LINE>My attack has a height!
That's right.<LINE>The Pokémon do the fighting, not me...
We always play basketball<LINE>with Pokémon here!
I will show you a powerful serve!<LINE>Watch this burn in at 120 miles per hour!
Your attack just now...<LINE>More powerful!
Pokémon are sending over<LINE>some powerful serves so I can practice.
My Pokémon was so cute!
My Pokémon listened to what I said<LINE>and fought for me!
You... You came here because<LINE>somebody manipulated you.<LINE>If you can win against me,<LINE>I will tell you the secret!
Argh! I can't believe<LINE>I lost...
Ghetsis of the Seven Sages supports<LINE>our king, and Ghetsis has<LINE><LINE>three subordinates...<LINE><LINE>They are the Shadow Triad!
If I win against you,<LINE>release your Pokémon!
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>I'm mortified.
I don't understand... Your Pokémon seem<LINE>to be happy next to you.
Pokémon living in this Chargestone Cave<LINE>are so beautiful.<LINE><LINE>Because they are free from people.
Oh, my! No, no.<LINE>Plasmaaaa!
It's bad for ordinary Trainers like you<LINE>to use Pokémon.<LINE>It's good for us members of Team Plasma<LINE>to use Pokémon!
As a proud member of Team Plasma,<LINE>I will gladly battle with you.
As a proud member of...<LINE>Team Plasma...
What do you fight for?<LINE>No, what do you live for?
OK, Trainer, you use Pokémon!<LINE>Show me your strength!
...I see.<LINE>You're very good at using Pokémon.
Because they use Pokémon, people hold<LINE>competitions to sort out the strong from<LINE><LINE>the weak...<LINE>Is this fair? Is this right?<LINE>Are Pokémon just the Trainers' tools?
The hope of Team Plasma!<LINE>Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Hey! What was that?<LINE>You're too strong! Ugh!
The hope of Team Plasma!<LINE>We know our king will lead us.<LINE>He will free the Pokémon!<LINE>You! Release your Pokémon<LINE>and stop being a Trainer!
Since coming to Dragonspiral Tower,<LINE>my stress level has maxed out! The more<LINE><LINE>hyper I am, the faster you'll go down!
Bahhh.<LINE>I have lost my motivation.
Still, this is a great tower.<LINE>I feel not only its history<LINE>but also its awe-inspiring power.
Brycen, Cheren...<LINE>They are moving around being annoying.
I don't understand...<LINE>I don't understand you guys...
Why are you and the Gym Leaders<LINE>against us?<LINE><LINE>I just can't understand it at all.
I'm sure you also thought<LINE>“I am strong" and “I can win"<LINE><LINE>and came here.
Huh...<LINE>You thought right!
If the king of Team Plasma rules the<LINE>world, Trainers will disappear, and<LINE><LINE>disputes will end!
We exist to serve our lord N!
Ah!<LINE>Our lord N!
Because there are nights,<LINE>the sun is beautiful.<LINE>Because we exist,<LINE>our king shines...
The dawn of Unova<LINE>has faded in the distance...
Don't stop us!<LINE>I told you that we wouldn't stop.
What? It looks like you can still fight!
Even though I lost, I will still say:<LINE>Plasmaaaa, go Plasmaaaa!
My Pokémon can take that!<LINE>I'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...<LINE>This is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!<LINE>I'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...<LINE>This is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
My Pokémon can take that!<LINE>I'm sure! Well, probably...
Ummm...<LINE>This is kinda bad, right?
Aww. I lost.
Oh!<LINE>So, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,<LINE>it ends like this...
The Pokémon on both sides<LINE>tried sooo hard, didn't they?
Oh!<LINE>So, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,<LINE>it ends like this...

Oh!<LINE>So, you chose that move!
Every time I watch my Pokémon battle,<LINE>it ends like this...
The Pokémon on both sides<LINE>tried sooo hard, didn't they?
Moves that never miss<LINE>and moves that can attack first...<LINE><LINE>There sure are a lot of different moves.
It's important to choose<LINE>which item your Pokémon holds...
I see!<LINE>Losing to you means<LINE>that I still have a lot to learn.
Moves that never miss<LINE>and moves that can attack first...<LINE><LINE>There sure are a lot of different moves.

B-both my Pokémon and I are<LINE>going to give it our all!
OK!<LINE>This little one is up next!
Uh-oh...<LINE>Am I in trouble?!
Aww...<LINE>I couldn't win...
B-both my Pokémon and I are<LINE>going to give it our all!
OK!<LINE>This little one is up next!
Uh-oh...<LINE>Am I in trouble?!
Aww...<LINE>I couldn't win...
B-both my Pokémon and I are<LINE>going to give it our all!

Uh-oh...<LINE>Am I in trouble?!
Aww...<LINE>I couldn't win...
Hi, hi! Trainer!<LINE>I will let you see<LINE>what kind of Pokémon I have!
Did you see my Pokémon?<LINE>It's sturdy and great, isn't it?
Pokémon with the Sturdy Ability<LINE>cannot be knocked out with one hit!
Hi, hi! Trainer!<LINE>Please show me what kinds of Pokémon<LINE>you are training!
Great, great! I didn't know<LINE>that way to raise Pokémon!
When you let a Pokémon evolve, it will be<LINE>stronger, but if you don't let it evolve,<LINE><LINE>it will learn moves quicker.
I can't see up ahead<LINE>because of the sandstorm!<LINE>Because I can't see,<LINE>I'll have a battle with you!
S-a-n-d-s-t-o-r-m.
This parasol keeps off the sun and rain,<LINE>but it can't stand up to sandstorms...<LINE>Ah! My tears are falling on Route 4...
A battle on a raised walkway!<LINE>That's kind of cool.
Losing is uncool.<LINE>No, no, you are cool.
It's good to sway wildly<LINE>on a raised walkway!
I love raised walkways!<LINE>Balancing is fun,<LINE>so I often come here to play.
I lost, <LINE>but I won't stop!
If you walk on a raised walkway, you can<LINE>move without encountering wild Pokémon.<LINE>But if you stop to rest for a while,<LINE>you'll fall!
Originally, Pokémon lived<LINE>in the natural world!<LINE>So, it's good to train Pokémon<LINE>in nature like this!
I will start all over again.<LINE>We still have time.
Twist Mountain looks complicated, but<LINE>basically, it's a single road.<LINE>Keep cool and move forward!<LINE>That is the trick to reach the goal.
Being with Pokémon is natural.<LINE>Having a Pokémon battle is natural.<LINE><LINE>Why don't we test whether that is true?
We are happy to be with our Pokémon.<LINE>That's why we have battles!
If my Pokémon don't want to fight,<LINE>I will quit being a Trainer.<LINE>Because there are a lot of other things<LINE>I can do with my Pokémon.
Oh! <LINE>My groundbreaking research...
Prepare at least three Pokémon<LINE>that can fight!<LINE>Rotation Battles are new battles<LINE>with three Pokémon!
Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
Rotation Battles are shocking!!
Rotation Battles are Pokémon battles<LINE>with three Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>So prepare at least three Pokémon!
Today I am extremely lucky!
I didn't expect them to turn that way.<LINE>I am so unlucky!
Huh! <LINE>I was just unlucky today.
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle<LINE>in which you use three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon together<LINE>to use in battle!
OK! I will show you the results<LINE>of my daily workouts!
The result of my daily workout...<LINE>didn't really show up.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
In order to have a Triple Battle,<LINE>you need to have at least three<LINE><LINE>Pokémon able to battle.
OK, everyone!<LINE>Let's fight together!
Your Pokémon fought<LINE>harder than mine!
There are so many things to consider,<LINE>but that is part of the fun of<LINE><LINE>Triple Battles!
I choose a move, and<LINE>my Pokémon will do the move.<LINE>In a moment, that move will<LINE>reach your Pokémon!
I lost, but during the battle,<LINE>we were connected. Right?
This Berry may connect<LINE>you and your Pokémon.
From today to tomorrow...<LINE>people, Pokémon, and the world...<LINE>I love this connected feeling...
I am not running now,<LINE>but I usually barrel through<LINE><LINE>as quickly as I can!
I have not crossed<LINE>the finish line of victory!
I'm going to use this little rest<LINE>to give you this present!
Run and run in cities<LINE>and on mountain paths!<LINE>Run and feel the world around you<LINE>with your whole being!
I am just watching<LINE>the dangling tip of the fishhook.<LINE>Since you and I have met, let's send<LINE>our Pokémon out to meet in battle!
Because I love fishing and Pokémon,<LINE>I enjoy my life twice as much.
The dangling tip of the fishhook.<LINE>I am just watching it.<LINE>Yes, in life, even meaningless things<LINE>can have meaning.
Ouch... Why are you<LINE>so strong?
Wow! Wow! Great!<LINE>You are stroooong!!
Hey! <LINE>Your team is strong!
Ouch... I'm so uncool...
After all, I am the strongest and greatest.<LINE>Just kidding!
Your strength...<LINE>And my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?<LINE>Is winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.<LINE>But what is it to be truly strong?
Your strength...<LINE>And my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?<LINE>Is winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.<LINE>But what is it to be truly strong?
Your strength...<LINE>And my strength... Right. Let's test them.
Can you be strong even if you lose?<LINE>Is winning everything?
Pokémon battles are fun.<LINE>But what is it to be truly strong?
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle<LINE>that uses three Pokémon.<LINE>Please prepare at least three Pokémon<LINE>for battle!
The flow of a game changes<LINE>every turn in a Rotation Battle!<LINE><LINE>Can you master it?
It made my head spin,<LINE>and I feel dizzy...
While a come-from-behind win is possible,<LINE>if you are a strong Trainer,<LINE><LINE>you can handle the game well.<LINE><LINE>That is the thrill of Rotation Battles!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle<LINE>in which you use three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon together<LINE>to use in battle!
I thought and thought<LINE>and chose these three!<LINE><LINE>Their destructive force is overwhelming!
Did I position them wrong?<LINE>Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Which Pokémon<LINE>should I put in the middle...?<LINE><LINE>I'm still thinking about it.
My!<LINE>Special Emolga?!
Fishermen read the flow of water<LINE>or the flow of a battle!
The flow of the battle...<LINE>It's too wild to follow!
The flow of water here on Route 17<LINE>is very wild.<LINE>If you don't tap into it well,<LINE>you cannot go where you want!
I am good at backstroke,<LINE>freestyle, butterfly...<LINE><LINE>And, of course, Pokémon battles!
Did I just lose a Pokémon battle,<LINE>even though I'm so good at them??
Shall I practice my swimming?<LINE>Or shall I train my Pokémon?<LINE>Hmmmm, it's hard to decide,<LINE>so I will swim with my Pokémon!
The Pokémon is riding the wave,<LINE>and you are riding the Pokémon.<LINE><LINE>Are you riding high?
The big wave has come and gone...<LINE>My heart is calm...
If you can surf calmly through the<LINE>rough waters of your life,<LINE><LINE>you'll be riding high!
I learned all the good points of my<LINE>Alomomola by swimming with Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>I will show off its strength!
What a fresh Trainer!<LINE>Really fresh, fresh!
I'm a girl with everything...<LINE>Well, everything but a place to<LINE>put my Poké Balls!
I was taking a little break, but hey,<LINE>I always have time for Pokémon battles!<LINE><LINE>Let's enjoy it as much as possible!
Wooosh!<LINE>Ssshhhh!!
I'll tell you why I was taking a break.<LINE>I have trouble with my bikini.<LINE>It could be washed away...
Did you come here by looking<LINE>at the Town Map, too?<LINE>Maps are good.<LINE>They tell you a lot of things!
I want something that's like a map but<LINE>tells me how to fight instead of where to go.
Where shall I go next...?<LINE>I use the Town Map to decide!
I came all the way here<LINE>looking for various Pokémon.<LINE>Let me see what kinds of Pokémon<LINE>you came here with!
Your Pokémon is...<LINE>Very cool!!
There are Pokémon Trainers<LINE>across the water, too.<LINE>I wonder what kinds<LINE>of Pokémon and Trainers live there...
Fights have their own rhythms!<LINE>I wonder whose Pokémon<LINE>can fight rhythmically.
Your Pokémon!<LINE>Their movements are right on the beat!
I am living with so many rhythms!<LINE>My rhythm, the Pokémon's rhythm,<LINE>and nature's rhythm...
When I look down from a high place,<LINE>I feel very good!<LINE>Pokémon battles are the same!<LINE>I will fight looking down from the heights!
You're great!<LINE>I can't help but look up to you!
We climb mountains because,<LINE>no matter how hard it is,<LINE><LINE>the higher we climb,<LINE><LINE>the closer we get to the sky!
On a small rise of land...<LINE>you and I face each other...
On a small rise of land,<LINE>I lost and was left speechless...
On a small rise of land...<LINE>What am I seeing...?<LINE>So many Trainers I faced before...<LINE>How many more Trainers I can fight...<LINE>I will cherish every battle.
Are you going deeper into Pinwheel<LINE>Forest? Or to the challenge rock?<LINE>Either way, unless you are tough,<LINE>you'll be just rooted to the spot!
Oh, my...<LINE>You are very tough!
Tough Trainer!<LINE>I will make your Pokémon healthy.
Around Pinwheel Forest, many Pokémon<LINE>use moves to inflict problems such as<LINE><LINE>poison and paralysis.<LINE><LINE>If anything happens, let me know!
Really bad!
Zowie-e-e-e!
Mmmmm...?!<LINE>That's how you showed up?
Your power exceeds my<LINE>psychic power!
People say the Musharna that show up<LINE>here every Friday are a bit different.
This is a power spot!<LINE>It awakens your dormant power!
Did you spot my weakness?
To tell you the truth,<LINE>everybody has Dream Mist.<LINE>'Cause if you can make a dream come true,<LINE>it's the same as having Dream Mist.<LINE><LINE>Right?
Eeek! Why? I foresaw your move,<LINE>and I was running away from you.
Eeek! I foresaw your thoughts,<LINE>but I lost!
Dreams slip away when they almost<LINE>come true...<LINE>If you don't grab important things tight,<LINE>you will lose them.
To research strange Pokémon, having a<LINE>battle is a good approach.<LINE>Don't you think?
I cannot help but wonder...<LINE>Why did I lose?
No matter how much you research,<LINE>Pokémon are full of new discoveries!
I've been researching<LINE>without sleeping for days.<LINE><LINE>I see you, but are you a dream?
Theoretically, it's impossible!<LINE>Is this a dream...?
Talking about dreams, Fennel's<LINE>Pokémon DW!<LINE><LINE>That is some great research!<LINE><LINE>Are you doing Game Sync, too?
For my research on dreams,<LINE>I will research your dream!
No! <LINE>I may dream about this defeat later!
The Dream Mist of the<LINE>Pokémon Musharna...<LINE>The secret has not been unlocked,<LINE>but it must be a great ability.
I want to figure out<LINE>Psychics' strange powers!
I decided to fight using pure logic,<LINE>yet I lost!
The things we can explain with logic<LINE>are half of the world...<LINE>The rest, we explain with feeling!<LINE>Because the world is full of wonders.
Permets-moi de te provoquer en duel afin<LINE>que je puisse graver notre rencontre<LINE><LINE>dans ma mémoire.
Notre combat est à jamais gravé<LINE>dans ma mémoire!
Les paysages que nous avons admirés...<LINE>Les gens que nous avons rencontrés...<LINE>Les Pokémon avec qui nous avons<LINE>croisé le fer...<LINE>Ils resteront à jamais gravés<LINE>dans ma mémoire.
Tu n'imagineras jamais le nombre de<LINE>pays que j'ai visités, et le nombre<LINE><LINE>de Dresseurs que j'ai combattus!
Wah!<LINE>Encore un formidable souvenir de voyage!
Quand j'aurai beaucoup, beaucoup<LINE>voyagé, je rentrerai à la maison,<LINE><LINE>et je pourrai raconter tout<LINE><LINE>plein de choses à ma famille!
The power of thundering waterfalls...<LINE>Experience the great power<LINE>of a battle with me!
I cannot believe our attack<LINE>had no impact on you!!
I admit your strength<LINE>and give you this gift!
Maybe I should train my body and mind<LINE>by standing under a waterfall!
My Pokémon and I spend so much time<LINE>together, we don't need words<LINE><LINE>to understand one another.<LINE>Do you think you can win against us?
You can understand each other<LINE>very well, too!
When you see this Berry,<LINE>please remember us!
I enjoy working as a Ranger, but I love<LINE>to spend my time with Pokémon!<LINE>Whatever happens, I won't leave<LINE>my Pokémon!
Are you raising these Pokémon all alone?<LINE>Or do you rely on Pokémon Day Care?
I was only thinking about Eggs...
Share this Berry with<LINE>your precious Pokémon!
The Pokémon Day Care on Route 3!<LINE>If you leave two Pokémon there,<LINE>you may find an Egg!
My Pokémon are running around<LINE>in this beautiful grassland...<LINE><LINE>Please take a look!
They were bouncing around<LINE>just a few minutes ago!
Share the Berry with your Pokémon, too!
They must have been tired<LINE>because they were running around.<LINE><LINE>Aww! So cute!
It's OK to have a battle<LINE>during a picnic. Right?
Fey: Your Pokémon are<LINE>great friends, aren't they?<LINE>Sue: It was over while I was<LINE>considering what my partner would do.
I think the Pokémon in the Poké Balls<LINE>totally understand how you feel!
We two are having a picnic together!<LINE>Don't you have two Pokémon?
We will rattle you and your Pokémon<LINE>with our perfect combination.

To battle well in a Double Battle,<LINE>we have to know<LINE><LINE>our partner's Pokémon moves.
We fight as a duo.<LINE>So you need at least two Pokémon.
I was checking for Pokémon<LINE>around here just now,<LINE><LINE>but I am also interested in you.
Oh! <LINE>What interesting Pokémon!
Even similar Pokémon will have<LINE>different behavior and appearances<LINE><LINE>in Unova and other regions.
I was checking the landscape<LINE>around here just now,<LINE><LINE>but I am also interested in you.
Oh, my!<LINE>What an interesting Trainer!
The unevenness of this landscape...<LINE>We can tell that the flow of a river<LINE><LINE>created the undulation.
From my point of view,<LINE>art is feeling and logic!<LINE>And a beautiful battle is also<LINE>feeling and logic!
I could not see your strength?!
Artists can be divided<LINE>into two types...<LINE>Some draw what they see,<LINE>and some draw what they can't see!
I am a wonderful Fisherman<LINE>who loves everything!<LINE>This Fisherman will fight<LINE>with wonderful Pokémon!!
I lost!<LINE>But I still love everything!
I want to go deep-sea fishing<LINE>using the Royal Unova<LINE><LINE>that leaves from Castelia City!
Don't be overwhelmed<LINE>by my awesome Pokémon!
I'm so overwhelmed that I cannot speak...
Is my fishing rod bad?<LINE>Or is it my fishing skill that's bad?<LINE><LINE>I always catch the same Pokémon.
Hm! You look like a competent<LINE>Pokémon Trainer!<LINE>If I have a battle with you,<LINE>I may learn some secrets!
Yep! A strong person is strong.<LINE>And a weak person is weak.
The secret of fishing...<LINE>Isn't it “hurry up slowly"?
Hey! Please show me what kinds<LINE>of great Pokémon you have caught!
Ho ho!<LINE>These are some impressive Pokémon!
Even if others catch great Pokémon,<LINE>I won't get jealous.<LINE>Because my own Pokémon<LINE>are the best ones for me!
Our Pokémon make a nice matchup!
Emy: No, I can't believe it!<LINE>How come you're so strong?<LINE>Lin: Our team is the best in the whole world<LINE>ever! How did you beat us?
If Pokémon are good friends,<LINE>they will be filled with power!
What? Only one Pokémon?<LINE>Then, we can't fight!
Our combination is the best!<LINE>There is no chance we will ever lose!

The Abilities called Plus and Minus<LINE>are the best combination! Right?
What? Only one Pokémon?<LINE>Sorry, we won't battle with you!
While we watch the beautiful scenery,<LINE>let's have an exciting Pokémon battle!
I was absorbed in our Pokémon battle.
The quiet sound of a multitude of waves<LINE>endlessly overlapping...<LINE>It's like a first-class orchestra...<LINE>Doesn't it sound like that?
I will keep walking<LINE>on the sandy beach...<LINE>How about that?<LINE>Sounds pretty great, doesn't it?
I'd have more fun<LINE>just walking on the beach...
I walk on the sandy beach...<LINE>Because I love footprints!
Oh?<LINE>A lovely Trainer.<LINE>Would you like to meet the Pokémon<LINE>that make me proud?
Uh...<LINE>Shocking!!
...Looking back, when I had<LINE>ups and downs, my Pokémon<LINE><LINE>were always there for me.
Oh, a traveling Trainer!<LINE>Let's battle, just for fun!
Huh? Is it already over? Noooo!<LINE>I want to see more Pokémon!
When Pokémon use moves, or when they<LINE>see you and catch your eye, your heart<LINE><LINE>beats a little faster, doesn't it?
A woman standing alone with a parasol<LINE>in one hand at the beach...<LINE><LINE>Hi... Please have a battle with me.
The parasol can block ultraviolet rays, <LINE>but it can't block moves...
I heard a parasol is a must<LINE>on the beach...<LINE><LINE>But I'm the only one who has one?
What? Will you fight against me?<LINE>It's OK, but are you strong?
Ugh...<LINE>Your Pokémon are strong!
I'm happy when I am with my Pokémon!<LINE>That means I will be happy for years<LINE>to come! Because I'm always with them!
If I battle until I win, I will never<LINE>ultimately lose!
Try seven times and fall eight times...<LINE>No!<LINE><LINE>Fall down seven times, stand up eight!
The more I rise up,<LINE>the stronger my mind grows!<LINE>That's why I thank you for each round<LINE>that I lost!
Do you understand why Trainers<LINE>and Pokémon are together?
You and your Pokémon share<LINE>the sad feeling of losing half-and-half...
With a friend, you laugh twice for happy<LINE>things, and you cry half for sad ones.<LINE><LINE>That is the joy of living with Pokémon.
An expert Fisherman can time many things<LINE>perfectly and precisely!
Hmmmm! A lot of my timing<LINE>didn't go well!
You! It's impressive that<LINE>you have a Super Rod!<LINE>OK! Probably you know, but<LINE>I will tell you how to use it!<LINE>First, you face any body of water,<LINE>then you cast with your Super Rod.<LINE>Next you must focus!<LINE>When a Pokémon bites,<LINE>“!" appears.<LINE><LINE>That's your cue to reel it in!
On a bridge!<LINE>Fighting Trainers!<LINE><LINE>It's a perfect picture!
I am not weak, even though I lost.<LINE>You, who won, are just too strong!
On a bridge!<LINE>A sentimental Trainer after his defeat!<LINE><LINE>This is also a good, tragic picture!
My Pokémon climbed many mountains and<LINE>built up their physiques!
My tears fell after the defeat.<LINE>Watch them become an ocean!
With the Pokémon move Waterfall,<LINE>a Pokémon can climb a waterfall!<LINE>...There is no move called Mountainfall.
I will battle with you,<LINE>but you must relax your shoulders.<LINE>Because you need to relax<LINE>to show your ability.
Natural stance!<LINE>You are good!
When people try to do what they can't,<LINE>they become clumsy.<LINE>If they do what they can do very well,<LINE>they can always be themselves!
I will unveil my Pokémon to you!<LINE>They are the best in the world!
Your Pokémon are also cute,<LINE>but my Pokémon are charming!
Listen. My love for my Pokémon<LINE>is the best in the world.<LINE><LINE>Nobody can beat it.
Se ripenso a quante montagne<LINE>ho attraversato in lungo e in largo,<LINE><LINE>mi viene tanta voglia di una lotta.
Vengono in mente altre lotte in<LINE>cui ho perso proprio come adesso!
La strada percorsa non si cambia!<LINE>Ma su quella da percorrere<LINE>può accadere ancora di tutto!
What's wrong, Pokémon Trainer?<LINE>Are you lost in your journey?<LINE>No... In your life? At times like that,<LINE><LINE>if you fight, you'll know!
You have no doubts<LINE>about your way of fighting!
Such a strong Trainer!<LINE>Please accept this!
Life itself is a journey, and it's<LINE>natural to get lost sometimes!<LINE>Some truths you can find<LINE>only when you get lost!
Yoo-hoo, Pokémon!<LINE>Yoo-hoo, Pokémonnnn!<LINE><LINE>Yoo-hoo, are you a Trainer?!
A tough Trainer,<LINE>and a tough Pokémon. I lost.
I will give you this as a sign<LINE>of my respect for your toughness!
I am checking to see whether Pokémon<LINE>that came from other regions<LINE><LINE>by Poké Transfer have escaped.
I'm looking for a place...<LINE>that is not in any guidebook.
Your strength!<LINE>I want to put it in a guidebook!
A journey to find something new!<LINE>That is my goal.<LINE>For example, that big rock!<LINE>You can push it with the move Strength!
Amazing, to find a quiet spot like this<LINE>right next to the big city!<LINE>Wow! I got a little excited,<LINE>so I want to have a battle!
Well, I have calmed down.
Do Pokémon also<LINE>feel calm in nature?<LINE>Or do they also enjoy<LINE>the glitz of cities?
Because all roads are connected, I can<LINE>go anywhere and challenge anyone!
I felt the bond between<LINE>you and your Pokémon!
I keep traveling<LINE>to forget my sadness...<LINE>But the sad memory returns<LINE>every time a season passes.
I ride a Bicycle,<LINE>I feel fresh winds,<LINE><LINE>and I win Pokémon battles!
A pleasant wind is carrying a defeat.<LINE>...Now, it is stopping here, though.
Most people don't know this,<LINE>but coming to Nimbasa<LINE><LINE>and riding a Bicycle is very popular.
Ting-a-ling-ling. ♪<LINE>I will have a Pokémon battle<LINE>at this speed!
I'm upset because I lost,<LINE>so I will ring the bell. Ting-a-ling. ♪
If you ride a Bicycle,<LINE>you zip along!<LINE>If you are with Pokémon,<LINE>you can do many things.<LINE>It's fun to do things<LINE>you can't usually do!
I am patrolling.<LINE>I will check your strength, too!
You were so strong<LINE>that I couldn't help falling back!
Nothing scares me<LINE>when I patrol with my Pokémon!
I will show you the harshness<LINE>of the desert through a battle!
Desert...hot... Mouth...dry... Grfrrrfl...
Be careful of burns!
If a Pokémon gets a burn, <LINE>it also weakens physical attacks.<LINE><LINE>This works quite well!
Scorching desert!<LINE>A passion for adventure!<LINE><LINE>And a heated battle!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!!
Speed is crucial<LINE>to treat a burn!
Whether it is hot or cold,<LINE>there is no problem if you have passion!
But you are just so relaxed! How could you<LINE>win against a busy person like me?
Oh, my! How strong you are!
Oh!<LINE>Impressive strength!
Oh... I lost.<LINE>You're very strong!
What?<LINE>How could I lose?
This...<LINE>This is ridiculous!
Your strength was more than I imagined!<LINE>I am pleased!
Come on! Seriously?! All I did was<LINE>take away people's Pokémon.
We finally reached the secret sleeping in<LINE>the basement of the lighthouse.<LINE><LINE>I won't let you interrupt us!
I am bitterly disappointed...
In the basement of the lighthouse<LINE>built over 200 years ago,<LINE><LINE>the mythical Pokémon<LINE><LINE>Victini was sleeping!
I was ordered not to let anyone<LINE>approach the Plasma Ship!
I lost the battle though...
Although I lost, I won't move!<LINE>I will follow my orders!
We will release Victini<LINE>from its confinement<LINE><LINE>in a small basement on the island!
You're sabotaging<LINE>our noble cause!
Selfish people are making<LINE>Victini suffer...
The Victini on this island<LINE>creates limitless energy!
You are just a kid!
If you are exposed to Victini's energy,<LINE>you can win any kind of battle.
I failed to seize the victory!
The beginning is always important<LINE>for both battles and novels.
Oh... I guess it's time to start<LINE>my last chapter.
The epilogue of this story<LINE>is about to begin.
Wow. I'm stunned.<LINE>For all the words I know, I can't figure out<LINE>how to say this... Putting my feelings<LINE><LINE>into words would just be a trap.<LINE>All I will say is I feel you're even greater<LINE>than I thought!
You use the move here...<LINE>It's good. It's fascinating.
Well... I've never withdrawn<LINE>from any battles.
Even in this situation,<LINE>there must be a way...to win.
If somebody wins, the person who fought<LINE>against that person will lose.<LINE><LINE>That's battle.<LINE>A good contender just seeks the next<LINE>victory without bragging after winning,<LINE><LINE>and without getting upset after losing.
Oh! Strong as usual.<LINE>That makes my heart dance!
The last one!<LINE>I'll use the last bit of strength!
Oh... This may be the last.<LINE>I will put everything into the next move!
There is no strongest Pokémon or single<LINE>best combination...<LINE>So, there are no guarantees of winning.<LINE>But the determination to be strong and to<LINE>continue to grow and improve is itself a<LINE><LINE>great strength. It's the determination<LINE><LINE>that you show that makes me respect you.
A wonderful time is about to start.<LINE>I like this moment...
I will stay cool and collected, even though<LINE>this isn't going well...
I will not give up...for the sake of my<LINE>Pokémon that believe in me.
As you have always been...or even more<LINE>than ever...<LINE><LINE>you are an elegant and excellent Trainer.<LINE>Your Pokémon also have class.<LINE>I am very pleased to have battled you.
Do you really think you can stop us<LINE>with that?
My last friend...<LINE>Please share your courage with me!
Is the world going to choose you,<LINE>and not me?!
Everything’s ruined. The ideals I held...<LINE>The dreams Pokémon shared...
Your Pokémon look happy.
Even if I lose, is it different from the<LINE>future I saw?
The result was the same...<LINE>But you... Who are you?
When was the last time<LINE>I was driven into a corner like this?
You haven't won yet! I won't let<LINE>such a fun battle end so easily!
My heart is pounding so hard because I had<LINE>such a heated battle with you.<LINE>You are a really great Trainer!!
I bought new boots,<LINE>so I came all this way to get them dirty.<LINE>You're right! If I have a battle,<LINE>they may get even dirtier!
Oh! My boots got completely soaked<LINE>in the battle!
I would feel sorry for boots<LINE>if I cared about them getting dirty.<LINE>Pokémon are the same. Right?<LINE>I feel sorry for them getting hurt,<LINE><LINE>but it makes them stronger.
If there are Trainers,<LINE>I just have battles with them.<LINE>Because they may show me<LINE>Water-type Pokémon<LINE><LINE>I've never seen.
I've never seen<LINE>such a strong Trainer!
If I find water, I drop in my fishing line.<LINE>Because even with a puddle,<LINE>there may be Pokémon<LINE><LINE>that I've never seen.
Knowing oneself, knowing the other,<LINE>and knowing the surroundings...<LINE><LINE>That's a Ranger!
I guess there's still<LINE>a lot I don't know!
If you are prepared,<LINE>you don't have to worry!
I'm researching what kinds of<LINE>Pokémon live around here.<LINE>That way, I can plan which Pokémon<LINE>I should take along.
Pokémon Trainers nurture friendship<LINE>with their battles!
This feeling of defeat...<LINE>is like a bottomless swamp...
Please accept this Sitrus Berry<LINE>as a token of our friendship!
Stay still and listen carefully!<LINE>Hear the sounds of nearby Pokémon...<LINE><LINE>the breath of trees and swamps.
I got tired of Pokémon battles<LINE>with the same people,<LINE><LINE>so I want to have a battle with you!
Wow! Surprising!<LINE>The move just now was great!
The Pokémon called Burmy<LINE>can change their forms<LINE><LINE>depending on where they battle!<LINE><LINE>Isn't that great??
Eeek!!<LINE>Hey! Don't sneak up<LINE>on me like that!
Argh, I lost again...<LINE>I'm a little bit sad.
I was writing this and that on the wall.<LINE>Oh, I will never show it to you!<LINE>...Because it's my secret!
Let's compare whose Pokémon<LINE>are stronger!
You won!<LINE>Your Pokémon are awesome!
I scrape my legs a lot<LINE>'cause I'm wearing shorts.<LINE>But I'm fine!<LINE>My Pokémon lick the scraped parts!
This is our playground!<LINE>Great Landorus, watch out for us!
Wahaha!<LINE>Your Pokémon looks like it is having fun!
Great Landorus...<LINE>Is it a strong and kind Pokémon?
If you have the move Dive,<LINE>you can dive and sink!
Blub, blub, blub...<LINE>...I am sinking.
Have your Pokémon<LINE>learned the move Dive?<LINE>Dive is good! Great!<LINE>'Cause it's Dive!
I just love swimming, so I have only<LINE>fought against wild Pokémon.
I guess people get strong<LINE>by visiting Gyms!
OK! I will challenge Pokémon in Gyms<LINE>all over the world!<LINE>Where do I find Water-type Gyms...<LINE>Kanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, right?
My Pokémon and I are always swimming.<LINE>Of course, I can battle while swimming!
I lost. But I'm still cool, because not many<LINE>people can say they battled while swimming!
They say a temple sank<LINE>to the ocean floor in Undella!
Seeing a Pokémon use its best moves<LINE>against another Pokémon<LINE><LINE>is really an adventure!
The adventure is over already.
I am on vacation<LINE>all year round...
Oh? Did you come here to see<LINE>Cynthia in a bathing suit?
You should put on a bathing suit and swim<LINE>instead of riding on a Pokémon!
I heard that Cynthia swims secretly<LINE>when nobody else is around.<LINE>And I heard she is great!<LINE>Just great!
The sea waves in Undella Town are<LINE>nice and calm!
Your battling style<LINE>is very rough and ready!
Floating in the sea, very nice!<LINE>Being with Pokémon, very nice!
What I learned after reading many books<LINE>is that there are still a lot of mysteries<LINE><LINE>in the world!
How we can be friendlier with Pokémon<LINE>is also a mystery.
The book I am reading now was<LINE>written by Professor Juniper.<LINE>It says the origin of Pokémon<LINE>is still a mystery.
I've been researching the Village Bridge,<LINE>but taking a break is also important!
You and your Pokémon!<LINE>You are supporting each other perfectly!
In the Village Bridge,<LINE>a lot of bricks support each other<LINE><LINE>and keep the bridge from collapsing.<LINE>That's how the bridge has kept its shape<LINE>for over 100 years.
My journey has taught me<LINE>that everybody loves Pokémon!<LINE><LINE>I'm sure you love them, too.
Although we lost,<LINE>our journey will still continue!
We will keep walking!<LINE>As long as the road goes on...<LINE><LINE>As long as I am with my Pokémon!
You are the 99th person<LINE>that I have greeted this way.<LINE>Let's have a Pokémon battle!
Thank you! Now you and I are friends.<LINE>Right?
If we could greet anyone in the world<LINE>with “Let's have a Pokémon battle!"<LINE><LINE>that would be wonderful!
My movements lack power!
I was off the beat!<LINE>I have to start up my lessons again!
My footwork was not quite sharp.
Plasmaaaa!<LINE>I have fallen in the Relic Castle...
The strength that beat my lord N.<LINE>I see... It cut me to the bone.
That strength has protected<LINE>the world in which people and Pokémon<LINE><LINE>live together.
I will use everything that I've learned on<LINE>this journey!
My Pokémon and I will<LINE>put all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.<LINE>You are really great.
I will use everything that I've learned on<LINE>this journey!
My Pokémon and I will<LINE>put all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.<LINE>You are really great.

My Pokémon and I will<LINE>put all our energy into this battle!
Thank you.<LINE>You are really great.
Did you see how I trained it?
Did you see how I trained it?
I trained the Pokémon you traded me<LINE>very well, right?
I'm a heartbreaker...<LINE>My name... Charles.
I'm a heartbreaker...<LINE>My name... Charles.
I know all my strengths and weaknesses now.<LINE>Soon, I will also know yours!
It's not over yet.<LINE>My Pokémon are with me!
I believe in my Pokémon's strength,<LINE>so I don't lose my calm.
Thank you!<LINE>I saw what was missing in me.

I see...<LINE>You choose that move?!
S-s-still... That's fine.<LINE>We're just fine!
Uh...at a time like this,<LINE>I am supposed to do...what?
Thank you for having a battle with me!<LINE>I definitely learned something!

Triple Battles are battles with<LINE>three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon ready<LINE>for battle!
Which Pokémon you use...<LINE>Yes! Preparation before a battle<LINE>is very important for Triple Battles!<LINE><LINE>Now, let's start!
Be ready! Stay prepared so<LINE>you can battle anytime!

Triple Battles are new battles<LINE>with three Pokémon!<LINE>You cannot fight if you don't have<LINE>at least three Pokémon.
Triple Battles are three-on-three<LINE>Pokémon battles.<LINE>I will overpower you with<LINE>my perfect combination<LINE><LINE>and overwhelming attack power!
Did I overthink it<LINE>because of the unfamiliar rules?
The balance of three Pokémon...<LINE>each with its own role...<LINE><LINE>I still have to do more research.
Rotation Battles are new battles<LINE>with three Pokémon!<LINE>You can't battle if you don't have<LINE>at least three Pokémon.
Rotation Battles are<LINE>new Pokémon battles<LINE><LINE>in which the positions always change.<LINE>I will overpower you<LINE>while you are confused!

A Triple Battle is a new style of battle<LINE>in which you use three Pokémon!<LINE>Please get three Pokémon together<LINE>to use in battle!
Let me test what fighting style<LINE>is more effective!
By any chance, are you a<LINE>Triple Battle genius?!
If you'd like, please have<LINE>Triple Battles with your friends.
A Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle<LINE>that uses three Pokémon.<LINE>Please prepare at least three Pokémon<LINE>for battle!
Let me test what fighting style<LINE>is more effective!
By any chance, are you a<LINE>Rotation Battle genius?!
Now you can have Rotation Battles with<LINE>your friends!
Great plans are<LINE>always interrupted.
You... You are the Trainer<LINE>that my lord N is worried about!
You may have beaten me, but you're still no<LINE>better than other Trainers around here.
My lord N grew up with Pokémon...<LINE>He thinks about Pokémon more than<LINE>anybody else!
I will hurt anyone<LINE>who disobeys Team Plasma!
Ouch, ouuuuch!<LINE>My Pokémon got hurt!
You, before you came here,<LINE>how many Pokémon did you hurt?
I am a Trainer first<LINE>and a Doctor second!
Whenever I meet a Trainer,<LINE>I can't help having a battle...
Now, I will make<LINE>your Pokémon healthy!
Desert Resort is a harsh place.<LINE>Do you have medicines?
The more I fight along with my Pokémon,<LINE>the happier I will be!
I lost, but I am happy!<LINE>Because I have learned a few things!
Thinking about being happy<LINE>and making happiness a reality...<LINE><LINE>This is also science.
Ugh!<LINE>You choose a good move, as usual.
With my knowledge, I can bring out<LINE>the strength of my Pokémon!
Why do you keep beating me?<LINE>We have the same number of Gym Badges.<LINE>We should be equals in strength...
Ugh!<LINE>You choose a good move, as usual.

Ooohhh...<LINE>Am I in trouble?
I trained with Iris...<LINE>But I still couldn't win...
My Pokémon and me!<LINE>We trained and got tough!

Way to go!
They were rotating too much!
If that is the move you chose<LINE>after serious consideration, that's fine!
Woooo! Your inexhaustible fighting spirit!<LINE>Impressive!
Am I being overpowered?!<LINE>This is nothing! I will overpower you!
After the battle, a fresh wind<LINE>blew through my heart...<LINE>Use the battle with me as a stepping stone<LINE>and move forward!
