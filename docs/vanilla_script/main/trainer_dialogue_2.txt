Have we met or not? I don't remember.<LINE>Well, nice to meet you!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo!<LINE>I won again!
No way! Nooo way...<LINE>I lost again...
All right!<LINE>I will show you my power!
Amazed? Surprised?<LINE>By the power of my Pokémon?!
You are incredible!<LINE>I am astonished and surprised!
May... May I help you?!
Oh! Oh!<LINE>Yes, we can?!
Un-un-unbelievable!
Don't let your guard down,<LINE>or you may cry when a kid beats you...
I may be young, but I don't think<LINE>I will lose, even against grown-ups.
Fweh! I am just a kid!<LINE>You are fighting for keeps!
Let's have an awesome<LINE>Pokémon battle!
Mmmph! Mmmmmph!<LINE>You see, it's fun to win!
You are pretty amazing!<LINE>And you have totally exhausted me...
Very serious from the very beginning.<LINE>Are you ever really prepared for this?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is<LINE>seriously great!
Seriously, I lost. I am seriously depressed.<LINE>But you are seriously cool.
Go easy on me!<LINE>This is my first battle...
I can't believe I won my first battle!<LINE>Say, did you go easy on me?
Ouch! That hurts!!<LINE>But... You are great...
You... You know,<LINE>these Pokémon are my friends.
I... I... I am sorry...<LINE>I just wanted to introduce them to you.
Just being with these Pokémon<LINE>makes me happy...
...Heehee. I'm confident in calculation<LINE>and analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...<LINE>I don't feel like losing.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis<LINE>are no match for coincidence...
We're about to have a Pokémon battle.<LINE>At the very least, we say hello!
That could have gone better,<LINE>but thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,<LINE>but thank you very much.
I am studying every single day...<LINE>So I am taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun.<LINE>I want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...<LINE>I may be better at studying.
I want to be a Pokémon research<LINE>scientist when I grow up.
I'm wondering if Pokémon research<LINE>projects require test subjects...
I must do my best to learn<LINE>more about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...<LINE>I hope I will be all right...
Oops, you were not as strong<LINE>as I expected... Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!<LINE>What you see is what you get.
I always get the best grades!<LINE>I will try to be No. 1 for everything!
I will keep winning, winning, winning...<LINE>I will be No. 1!
If I lose at such an early stage,<LINE>I cannot be No. 1.
Wha--? You wanna fight with me?<LINE>I suppoooose...
Ah, I shoulda known.<LINE>Don't blame me.
Oh, wow. I am no match for you.<LINE>Your Pokémon are great.
Mrrrrr... Mmrr grrr...<LINE>Grrrrr... Mrrrrr...
Grrrrr... Mmrrrr...<LINE>...Oh? Did I win?
Grrrrmmm... Mrrr...<LINE>Oh? Is that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe and<LINE>the mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.<LINE>I am worried about your future prospects.
I got carried away.<LINE>I am worried about my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?<LINE>You look kind of hungry.
Have you eaten well?<LINE>You cannot do well on an empty stomach.
Are you really an ordinary person?<LINE>What do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,<LINE>so I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you lost.<LINE>Now, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you<LINE>my lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.<LINE>I don't think I will lose.
You see! I am fine as long as<LINE>I listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?<LINE>Please come and hug me!
A Trainer who looks gorgeous!<LINE>I hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost against me?!<LINE>I am a little disappointed.
Oh my, the battle was also gorgeous.<LINE>I find myself drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like?<LINE>Hey, hey. Let me see!
Your taste in Pokémon is excellent, <LINE>but you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,<LINE>but you are a first-class Trainer!
I am sorry--I lied.<LINE>I am not a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me<LINE>when I pretended to be rich.
The truth is I am just the daughter<LINE>of a Clerk ⑭.
Ahaha...
Ahahaha...
Argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!<LINE>Nice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!<LINE>Tank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!<LINE>Tank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!<LINE>I am already prepping for college.
You lost against a Preschooler...<LINE>How old are you again?
I am confident in studying, but<LINE>I am just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am a hero!<LINE>I refuse to lose!
I AM a hero!<LINE>I beat the bad person!
A hero never loses.<LINE>A hero never dies.
I am very strong.<LINE>I will never lose.
Daddy gave me these Pokémon!<LINE>They've got to be strong!
AAAAAAAAAH!
I thinks it are strange<LINE>it complaining when they lose.
When I win, I are glad!<LINE>Hip, hip, hurray!
Boo!! I did lost... I are frustrated,<LINE>but I guess things my own fault.
Are you going to bully me?
You didn't bully me. I like you!
You bullied me, but I like you<LINE>'cause you are strong!
Gmmmmm! Pokémon!<LINE>Give it all you've got!
Mmmmph! Yahoo! Yahoo!<LINE>Thank you very much, Pokémon!
Boooooo! Come on, Pokémon.<LINE>Try harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!<LINE>Trainer, do your best, too!
I am four years old! I did my best!<LINE>Trainer, you are weak.
I am four years old! I did my best!<LINE>Trainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...<LINE>I am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...<LINE>Drifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...<LINE>Until I see you again...
I am not an ordinary Backpacker,<LINE>'cause I am a newlywed.
'Cause my wife and I have no money,<LINE>we're hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
This trip is our honeymoon!<LINE>But I wandered off from my wife...
I am in the middle of my penniless travel.<LINE>It has its own charm.
Travel is best when you are poor<LINE>and when you are young.
Aww... I am hungry...<LINE>Please spare something...
Argh! My backpack is heavy!<LINE>Why is it so heavy?
Why is this backpack so heavy?<LINE>Did you put something in it?
Arrrgh! Why didn't you wait<LINE>until I put down my bag?!
I wanted a short trip to heal my broken<LINE>heart, but it's been a few months now...
A trip cannot heal my heartbreak...
I have no home to return to,<LINE>so maybe I will live as a drifter...
Hm. I wonder who you are.<LINE>I wonder if you'll have a battle with me.
You... You are weak.<LINE>Or am I just strong?
You are strong.<LINE>I wanna run away.
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.<LINE>I will relax here!
That was a nice, refreshing time.<LINE>I will work hard tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing.<LINE>Now I am more stressed out.
I hope to work hard, save money,<LINE>and have a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.<LINE>I just want to have a normal life.
I want to have security and happiness<LINE>rather than chasing a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! <LINE>We have very fresh ingredients!
What do you think of my Pokémon?<LINE>They are fresh!
Thank you very much!<LINE>How were mine?
Didn't you come here for<LINE>a Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or<LINE>you will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.<LINE>Please forgive me.
Hiya, honey! Welcome!<LINE>Have you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation<LINE>in a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory<LINE>in a Pokémon battle, sunny side up.
Meow, meow, it's a battle, meow.<LINE>(That sounds stupid, doesn't it?)
Yeah! Meow! I won, meow!<LINE>(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I lost, meowww.<LINE>(Seriously, I am sooo embarrassed.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than<LINE>anybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves<LINE>my true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should<LINE>help me win, shouldn't it?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon<LINE>that I am proudest of?
What do you think about my <LINE>dear Pokémon? Aren't they great?
Oh, my goodness!<LINE>My poor Pokémon...
For the honor of the branch office!<LINE>Here I go!
I am the branch manager of the Pokéfan.<LINE>I won!
Pfft. Good-bye for now, child!<LINE>I'll remember this!
I lost a lot of things because<LINE>I love Pokémon too much...
I've devoted my life to Pokémon. <LINE>I see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion.<LINE>What shall I do?!
Listen. I love love love Pokémon.
I will be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!<LINE>Please let me pet them!
I am not good at battling, but<LINE>this is one of the duties of a Pokéfan.
I kept the honor of the Pokéfan.<LINE>Hahaha.
Cheers, all you Pokéfans!!<LINE>May the Pokéfan last forever!
I wanted to go hiking,<LINE>but I took the wrong train.
Well, this place is also interesting.
Ah, mountains... The mountains are<LINE>calling me.
I am no mere Hiker.<LINE>Call me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me<LINE>is properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters.<LINE>That is an alpinist.
I'm a Fisherman, so I have my rod here,<LINE>but this is cumbersome.
I won the battle, but<LINE>I did not need this rod at all.
Ah... This rod is so cumbersome!<LINE>I will quit fishing!
Oh, I kin tell yer rilly sumpthin'.
I knew it. You rilly ARE sumpthin'.
Like always, the big one done got away.
I won't be a Parasol Lady without<LINE>a parasol, so I must use it.
I think it is strange to use<LINE>a parasol indoors, though.
My parasol... My parasol is broken!<LINE>I will be just a Lady.
My boyfriend left me on a rainy day.<LINE>So I will take it out on you.
The rain is piercing my broken heart<LINE>and washing it clean.
They say rainy days never stay,<LINE>but will the rain in my heart ever stop?
I've been waiting for someone like you<LINE>for a long, long time.
I know you are the best.<LINE>I will never let you go.
I like you.<LINE>Please be my friend.
I won't go easy on you just because<LINE>you're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You cannot have a battle<LINE>if you are afraid of losing.
Humph. I am still weak.<LINE>I feel sorry for my Pokémon...
I am bad and stupid, but<LINE>I am very serious about Pokémon.
I feel peaceful only when I am with Pokémon.
I hope you will find something<LINE>you can be serious about.
My shiny bald head is my secret.
The more I shave my head,<LINE>the stronger I can be.
You should have<LINE>a shiny bald head to be stronger.
You must be laughing at me 'cause<LINE>I rode this far on my motorbike.
I've decided to live my life on my bike.
I am a coward who cannot even go out<LINE>without my bike.
I am roaring around on my bike<LINE>and chasing my own dream.
I feel I am getting one step closer<LINE>to my dream.
You have to follow your own dream!
I am a Biker.<LINE>But I've never ridden a bike.
I am a Biker.<LINE>I don't have any friends yet.
I am a Biker.<LINE>I've never won yet.
My Pokémon are on the rise! I raised<LINE>them with special yeast bread!
You'll get well again if you<LINE>eat my special bread.
You are strong.<LINE>Are you eating my special bread?
One loaf, two loaves... No matter how<LINE>many times I count, one loaf is missing.
One loaf of bread is missing...<LINE>The master will be angry...
Oh, I'm so resentful...<LINE>Where is the missing loaf of bread?
Hey, you!<LINE>Do you eat a good breakfast every day?
I never miss breakfast,<LINE>so I am healthy and plump!
The first step for healthy living is<LINE>to eat a good breakfast.
I am not loafing on the job!<LINE>I am on patrol!
This place is dangerous!<LINE>This is too much fun!
I know about trouble like you!<LINE>I am keeping my eye on you!
I am a Policeman!<LINE>In other words, I am justice!
Justice always prevails!<LINE>That is why I won!
I... I am a Policeman!<LINE>Why did justice fail?
I got scolded by my boss, and I lost<LINE>my motivation. I'll take it out on you!
Hehehe. You see!<LINE>I am brilliant here.
Oh, man! <LINE>Am I useless here, too?
I am young and fresh!<LINE>I am nothing if not young!
What do you think? What do you think?<LINE>I am very strong, aren't I?
I am fine even when I lose a battle.<LINE>I am lively, lively!
I worked my way up to the top of the<LINE>comedians, and now I am a big shot.
You have a good sense of humor.<LINE>Do you want to be my assistant?
Looking at you reminds me of friends<LINE>from when I was working my way up.
I cannot do impressive stunts,<LINE>so I will perform normally.
I am sorry. I shouldn't have won.<LINE>I am just a Harlequin.
I am a Harlequin, but I'm sorry I cannot<LINE>play the fool after I lose.
I am smiling, though I am sad at heart.<LINE>This is the play of a lifetime!
You! That's not in the script!<LINE>You ruined the play!
Ha ha ha! It is the destiny of a Harlequin<LINE>to smile when he loses.
Oh, no! I came to play<LINE>without taking off my uniform.
Wow! Seriously? I won!<LINE>I cannot go home when I win.
Ahhhhh! And I lost!<LINE>This is not my day.
You know, I am very popular,<LINE>thanks to this costume.
Being popular is simple...<LINE>I like it that way.
I feel good 'cause I am popular, but<LINE>sometimes I feel empty.
Welcome back.<LINE>You must be tired from your work.
You must be tired.<LINE>Please do rest awhile.
That was superb!<LINE>You are very strong indeed.
I used to be so popular, but<LINE>now I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success, I took it<LINE>for granted, and I did not work hard.
As times change, values change.<LINE>I realized it too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.<LINE>If you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I will do a sketch of you,<LINE>frustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait. I can create a masterpiece<LINE>if you are my model.
Sensitivity is important for battles, too.<LINE>You! Feel it!
You need to feel it more! More!<LINE>Otherwise you cannot win!
Ahh! I sense it!<LINE>I sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Everybody grows bit by bit<LINE>if somebody cherishes them.
I have cherished these Pokémon<LINE>since they were small.
You are also here <LINE>because someone cherished you.
These days, when children fight,<LINE>their parents fight on their behalf.
Children of childish parents.<LINE>What kind of adults will they become?
Childish fights among adults are<LINE>worse than fights among kids.
Iaaaa! You are cute!<LINE>I want to take you home as my own!
Your face is cute even when you've lost!<LINE>I want to comfort you, little one!
Ooooh! You are really cute!<LINE>I want to raise you as my own!
I'll show you we can break you.<LINE>We've trained in the field!
How were my Pokémon?<LINE>They're very powerful, aren't they?
That's strange! I wonder why...<LINE>I shouldn't be outmuscled.
Oh, you look very active!<LINE>What say we battle?
OK! It's done!<LINE>How are my partners?
Goood, you are young!<LINE>My partners were totally crushed!
Pokémon battles after work<LINE>are the one thing I truly enjoy.
Ahhhhhhhhh!<LINE>That's why I cannot quit training Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh. It hurts.<LINE>It hurts for a single man like me.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.<LINE>Old guys can enjoy these battles!
Am I good for a guy who just<LINE>battles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy<LINE>battling with Pokémon.
Keep pedaling even when your legs<LINE>crumble. This is the secret of Cyclists.
A Pokémon trained by cycling<LINE>could never lose against a person like you.
My cycling has no limits.<LINE>I will challenge you again someday.
My steel-wheeled friend brought me here.<LINE>Isn't it the greatest ever?
This is my best friend forever!<LINE>Always reliable and true as steel!
I blundered, stumbled, and lost...<LINE>Well, I still have my one and only.
Fun time is over.<LINE>Time to wake up!
The end always comes as a shock.
You are greatly mistaken if you<LINE>think you can dream forever.
I'm done! It's just not good enough.<LINE>A Bicycle is not enough of a challenge.
A Bicycle cannot satisfy me.<LINE>I will join the Bikers!
Faster!! I want a speed that nobody<LINE>can beat!
I won't surrender to you.<LINE>You are nothing but a young fellow!
I won't lose against whippersnappers!<LINE>I shall struggle on until the day I die!
Impressive! You are skillful for a<LINE>green stripling, young fellow!
Like a powerful foaming cleanser,<LINE>I will remove you!
Like a well-polished tile,<LINE>this is a sparkling victory!
Like a worn-out dust rag...
I am doing this job because<LINE>I love love love trains.
You are happy if you choose something<LINE>you like as a job.
I love trains too much.<LINE>It's a sickness, really...
Your journey will end here.<LINE>I am your terminal.
I praise you for coming up here.<LINE>But now, go home!
Ah... I didn't see it coming.<LINE>I will rest over here...
I need to prove I'm worthy.<LINE>I cannot lose against a child.
Am I childish? Adults do<LINE>whatever it takes to win.
My honor, my pride... I cannot show myself<LINE>to my coworkers in such a miserable state.
Hey, I've learned a few things in my time.<LINE>Let me demonstrate!
Not everyone likes me, but<LINE>I am quite the Trainer, aren't I?
Your technique shows wisdom...<LINE>Are you also an old man?
They say a company with lively workers<LINE>is a good company!
I work hard all the time!<LINE>I can battle 24/7!
Oh, look at the time!<LINE>I have to get back to work!
My boss is seriously annoying!<LINE>I believe I'll take it out on you!
Thank you for having a battle with me.<LINE>I feel much better.
You should choose your company carefully,<LINE>because you cannot choose your boss.
Are you my next patient?<LINE>Get over here!
Good, good. I am glad<LINE>that you and your Pokémon are obedient.
Wait! You, wait!<LINE>The surgery has not started yet!
When there is a patient, I will be there.<LINE>That is my job.
Please put yourself at ease!<LINE>Your Doctor is here.
If you are hurt, please call me.<LINE>I'll be there for you.
Please go easy on me.<LINE>I just finished my night shift.
After all that work, let's relax<LINE>with some Pokémon battles!
Yawn... I'm sleepy...<LINE>I can't stay awake any longer...
How are you and your Pokémon?
I will inject you with my energy!
People can do so much<LINE>as long as they have energy!
A Gentleman should have<LINE>a liking for battles.
A Gentleman should bask<LINE>in the elegant glow of his victory.
A Gentleman should accept the result of<LINE>a battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hm... As a Trainer, you are<LINE>at the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are<LINE>at the level of Pokéfans.
You can learn a lot from mature women,<LINE>such as wisdom and good manners.
Woohoo! Were you knocked out by<LINE>the Socialite's charm?
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Oh-ho! Let's have a unique<LINE>and elegant battle.
Ah-ha! I was not confident, <LINE>but this is a delightful surprise.
Eeeeee! I'll remember this!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...<LINE>Pokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon,<LINE>even when you lose.
It is important to nurture and train<LINE>each Pokémon's characteristics.
Do you discipline your Pokémon?<LINE>Pampering them too much is no good.
You need to discipline Pokémon you<LINE>love when they are misbehaving.
Too much praise can spoil<LINE>both Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you.<LINE>They will return the love you give them.
This proves my love has been received<LINE>by my Pokémon.
It's about time for me to give someone<LINE>my affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for<LINE>training good Pokémon?
The tip for training good Pokémon is<LINE>to catch good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips<LINE>for training good Pokémon.
Glad you made it! It won't be<LINE>an easy job from here.
Haha! You see!?<LINE>You are not ready yet.
Earlier I got a little carried away,<LINE>but what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and dad are Ace Trainers.<LINE>So I am an Ace, too!
I want to be an Ace Trainer like<LINE>my mom and dad.
Waaaa! I should have superior genes and<LINE>be able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you<LINE>will get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see! You did not focus<LINE>on the battle. That's why you lost.
That is quite enough. It's over.<LINE>Don't stare at me!
Dad... Mom...<LINE>I'll have a battle. Look...
Dad... Mom...<LINE>Did you see me? I won... I won!
Dad... Mom...<LINE>What shall I do?
I came here to goof off.<LINE>I don't want to cram for the big test...
I cannot lose...<LINE>I don't want to study anymore.
No! I don't want to go home!<LINE>I don't want to study!
I just want to be successful<LINE>and grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and<LINE>put you to shame.
I don't care who you are<LINE>or where you come from.
How should we act?<LINE>That is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it?<LINE>After all, you are you, aren't you?
Pokémon battles and study sessions<LINE>are much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient.<LINE>You need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker?<LINE>I cannot believe it!
I have money to burn,<LINE>so I don't want anything.
The only thing I enjoy<LINE>is a Pokémon battle...
Just because I am rich<LINE>does not mean I am especially happy.
Yes! I am a Rich Boy!
Well, good-bye!<LINE>You have been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci!<LINE>You defeated a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,<LINE>but I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.<LINE>Please pay it no mind.
It's good when you battle for fun.<LINE>If it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a<LINE>battle. I am rich. I always have fun!
I do not have to work,<LINE>because I am loaded with cash.
All play makes me a dull girl.<LINE>Do you think I don't know that?
I'm proud of these Pokémon!<LINE>Go on, rush the enemy position!
My Pokémon are mighty!<LINE>I will carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't.<LINE>Someday, I will be able to win.
I came here for my big brother<LINE>who always hides in his room.
My big brother the hermit,<LINE>I won for you! Come out and play!
I wish my brother would<LINE>come out of his room and play with me...
Hello me old china,<LINE>time for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write,<LINE>Trainer, many clinks!
Even if you dipper, you'll be fine.<LINE>Best of friar, Trainer!
All Dad and Mom do is mumble<LINE>at their computers! That's no fun!
I don't like Dad, or Mom, or computers!<LINE>All I need are my Pokémon!
Instead of mumbling to computers,<LINE>I wish they would talk to me...
A globe-trotting young adventurer.<LINE>That's me!
Seeing Pokémon all over the world is<LINE>the purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.<LINE>Farewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy<LINE>with Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need<LINE>to have some breathing room.
No problem. No problem.<LINE>I will have another chance.
I've traveled 3,000 miles searching<LINE>for a husband! A journey to nowhere.
Please let me know if there is a rich,<LINE>wealthy, or affluent gentleman!
My goal is a wedding band...<LINE>But is that really a utopia?
A game is life,<LINE>but life is not a game.
I am always serious. You cannot win<LINE>if you think this is just a game.
I'll give up games forever and set out<LINE>on a journey... Just kidding!
I'll always work part-time, because<LINE>it lets me focus on what I really love.
You have only one life to live.<LINE>Are you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever<LINE>without being tied down.
I took this job 'cause I wanted to see<LINE>smiles on people's faces.
Don't look at me like that.<LINE>Smile! Smile!
It's very frustrating,<LINE>but I am glad I saw you smile.
Let's start a battle already!<LINE>We are wasting time.
What? Is it already over?<LINE>We still have lots of time.
We ran out of time.<LINE>We cannot go into overtime!
I am battling here to promote<LINE>the café where I work.
You are not that strong,<LINE>so you are not really right for my café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!<LINE>See you at my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokéfans.<LINE>Your life will be happy!
If you join the Pokéfans,<LINE>you'll be strong like me!
If you join the Pokéfans,<LINE>your life will be saved!
I am not a regular Pokéfan.<LINE>I am a major mega-Pokéfan!
I love Pokémon.<LINE>I love love Pokémon!
You'll remember this!<LINE>I am a big Pokéfan!
I think I am a Pokéfan,<LINE>therefore I am a Pokéfan.
The Pokéfan is power.
You should remember this.<LINE>I am a Pokéfan.
There are young and beautiful people,<LINE>but youth is different from beauty.
If I had known that when I was young,<LINE>I would not have a hard time now...
Youth is just youth.<LINE>I wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing<LINE>in my way, aren't ya?
Yahoooooo!! Yahoooooooo!<LINE>Hear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared<LINE>in a crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!<LINE>I am a Hiker. I have a cult following!
Oh no? It's over already?<LINE>Hiker is bored!!
This is important, so remember this!<LINE>Don't judge a book by its cover!
Despite my appearance, I am the head<LINE>of a certain outfit. Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone that I am playing here.
The boss does not have freedom.<LINE>I feel like a captured Pokémon.
The truth is, I want to have a quiet life<LINE>fishing all day, every day.
Ah... I don't want to do anything but fish.<LINE>I am tired of winning and losing.
At my time of life, it doesn't matter<LINE>if I win or lose.
Hello? Me? What, now?<LINE>I am about to have a battle.
Hello? Can you hear me?<LINE>I just won the battle.
Ah... Hello? Can you hear me?<LINE>Argh! I lost...
He told me that I was like a squall,<LINE>but what is a squall?
W-wah! Wahhh!<LINE>I am so happy that I am crying.
W-w-wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!<LINE>Wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!
No need to chat with someone<LINE>I'm about to battle.
Life is over if you lose.<LINE>That's why I hold out.
Don't look at miserable me!<LINE>Go away!
You have your way.<LINE>I have my way.
I will go my way 'cause<LINE>I don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky.<LINE>Good luck. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me,<LINE>or I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me,<LINE>but what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?<LINE>Gah, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans,<LINE>but I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad<LINE>if they see that I've become a Roughneck.
I cannot be like my mom and dad.<LINE>So I will live as a Roughneck.
My partner has turned to dust,<LINE>but his Pokémon is my Pokémon now.
Are you watching me, my long-lost partner?<LINE>That Pokémon of yours, we get along...
He was trash, but now he is eternal,<LINE>like the stars in the sky... Ah, my partner!
I am no good at speaking...<LINE>So my bike speaks...
Zooooom! Zoom whoosh!<LINE>Zooooom! Zoom zam!
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!<LINE>Vrooooooooom! Vroom!
All right! Are you ready?<LINE>Don't mess with a Biker!
I'm a Biker, so I'm more obsessed<LINE>with speed than anyone else!!
The truth is we are good guys.<LINE>We cannot do bad things at all!
Like uncooked dough,<LINE>my Pokémon are sticky!
Now you're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, your Pokémon are quite springy, too.
As I bake bread, I will bake your<LINE>Pokémon, too.
Oh my... Your Pokémon are like<LINE>burned bread.
Ah, how frustrating and disappointing!<LINE>You burned me with that last move...
Just as I knead the dough,<LINE>I'll knead you into shape.
Wanna be kneaded a little more?<LINE>Or shall I sandwich you with bread?
Ooooo! I'll remember this!<LINE>I'll turn you into a sandwich someday!
Laughing makes people feel better.<LINE>There seems to be scientific proof!
Haaa ha ha! Ha?<LINE>What's wrong? Let's laugh!
Laugh at miserable me--I lost against<LINE>amazing you. Laugh and you'll feel better.
You think you can win against me?<LINE>It might not go as smoothly as you think.
Don't underestimate me just because<LINE>I am a Harlequin.
No. This can't be happening.<LINE>You're not an ordinary person.
Observe my beautiful Pokémon magic!<LINE>Please watch closely!
I know a few gimmicks and tricks,<LINE>'cause this is magic.
Tricks and magic are my bread and butter.<LINE>Any Harlequin knows their worth!
Tedious talk is unnecessary...<LINE>I will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have low self-esteem,<LINE>so I like someone to give me orders.
You are not my boss, so<LINE>it doesn't matter even if you are weak.
Can I call you my boss?
This outfit is not a uniform,<LINE>it's what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.<LINE>Doesn't it look good on me?
I want to live in a world of games,<LINE>anime, and comics forever.
I'm not cut out for a regular job,<LINE>so I live on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they are<LINE>carefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah, if I can do a regular job,<LINE>I will quit doing this stinking art.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move,<LINE>my heart will tremble!
Nothing stirs the soul<LINE>more than Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful!<LINE>I could almost faint!
I will make you cry,<LINE>'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion<LINE>can also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value<LINE>of defeat and sorrow.
Our job is hard,<LINE>'cause it's such physical work.
My work gave me these great muscles.
Don't underestimate the power of kids.<LINE>Like I did with you!
Raising Pokémon and raising kids.<LINE>Both are very hard.
When my Pokémon do well like this,<LINE>I forget my everyday troubles.
Even I raise them with tender care,<LINE>because I am their Trainer...
Hey, you!<LINE>I promise I will take it easy on you!
Heheh... I will take it easy on you. Heh.
Sometimes even grown-ups want<LINE>someone to take care of them.
The job site is quite dangerous, but<LINE>I'll have to keep working with Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,<LINE>and it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I cannot make money tomorrow<LINE>'cause I am injured.
Welcome!
Only the winner!<LINE>Only the winner can celebrate.
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day.<LINE>Am I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down<LINE>the smooth running of this machine!
I may be happier than a person who<LINE>cannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker<LINE>that everybody is talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus!<LINE>Good-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker<LINE>everybody's talking about.
Well, let me introduce myself.<LINE>These are my little darlings.
How was it? My little darlings are tough and<LINE>cute, aren't they?
Phew! Your little darlings are awesome, too!
Whir, whir, whir, whoooosh!
Ring-ring! Ding-ding!
Bam!
This is the very latest model,<LINE>a limited-edition, carbon-fiber Bicycle.
When you have good tools,<LINE>you feel better about yourself.
Don't! Please don't touch my Bicycle.<LINE>You'll cover it with your filthy fingerprints.
Speed is the key in a battle!<LINE>Dash! Dash! Dash!
If I compare how I'm feeling right now to a<LINE>race, it is just like crossing the finish line!
I cannot take your nonsense anymore!<LINE>I am moving back to my mother's place.
Hey, you! Take out all the Pokémon<LINE>you have here!
Huh? That's all you have?<LINE>Aren't you hiding a few more Pokémon?
I see. There seems to be nothing<LINE>suspicious about you or your Pokémon.
I'll protect my peace by myself.
My peace remains protected.
Please don't disturb my peace and quiet.
I was born to work.<LINE>That is my destiny.
I will work, work, and work some more.<LINE>I am happy only when I am working.
As a matter of fact, having battles<LINE>is my job, too.
I'm-a lowest rank now, but<LINE>I'm-a gonna be at the top someday!
I'm-a gonna be the brightest star<LINE>in the business! Top of the world, ma!
You work it like a shining star!<LINE>I'm not gonna lose, I'm not gonna lose!
I have an ambition!<LINE>I will take over the company!
All this serves my ambition!<LINE>It brings my sweet victory one step closer!
I was obsessed with the golden prize,<LINE>with my glittering ambition!
I am treated as an idol at the office.<LINE>Everybody pampers me.
Everybody works for me,<LINE>so I have nothing to do.
The truth is I don't like brushing my teeth<LINE>or taking a bath, but don't tell anyone.
You look dusty.<LINE>I'll give you a good scrub!
OK, you look a little bit cleaner now!
Hey! Don't run away!<LINE>You need to be scrubbed more!
These fruits of stubbornness were raised<LINE>stubbornly by a stubborn old man.
This stubborn old man raised them.<LINE>My persistence is different from yours!
There's a fine line between persistence<LINE>and stubbornness. I may retire soon.
I'm good at driving, but<LINE>I'm not good at dealing with Pokémon.
Oh, it went unexpectedly well.<LINE>By any chance, am I a technician?
My train does what I need. It's harder to<LINE>convince living Pokémon to do things my way.
I've never left this place even once<LINE>since I was born.
I wonder if I will live here<LINE>for the rest of my life...
I wonder how long I will stay here...<LINE>What is there outside this world?
I say this as a Doctor.<LINE>First of all, you must save money.
Money cannot buy health.<LINE>But you cannot stay healthy if you're poor.
Because without money, you can neither<LINE>eat healthy food nor go to see a Doctor.
As you can see, I am a Doctor,<LINE>but I've never examined a patient.
I've studied to become a Doctor,<LINE>but I faint when I see blood.
I am a Sunday Doctor,<LINE>rather like a Sunday driver.
Can you understand<LINE>what medical personnel need?
What a Doctor needs is love--<LINE>the rush of unconditional love.
Medical service is love.<LINE>Can you be a Doctor?
I took this job because I wanted<LINE>to be needed by someone.
My job is hard,<LINE>but I am happy to help people.
When a patient leaves the hospital,<LINE>I feel happy but a bit sad.
Grown-ups have a lot of hobbies.<LINE>Actually, I am a uniform collector.
I am not a Nurse.<LINE>I wear this uniform just for fun.
You realized that I am a fake Nurse!<LINE>Yes, I am just a uniform collector.
Even if you are injured, I will treat you.<LINE>So let's fight hard.
Sorry! I went too far. Do you require<LINE>immediate hospitalization?
You went too far! I will bill you<LINE>the cost of my medical expenses!
I raised these very special Pokémon<LINE>using a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak<LINE>depending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this.<LINE>Did I blend the essence wrong?
Shall I share an exclusive tip<LINE>for training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book<LINE>of Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD<LINE>of Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family!<LINE>See the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!<LINE>Our family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My family!<LINE>What have you done?!
What you like and what you're good at<LINE>are different, or at least separate.
I am good at battling,<LINE>but I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job,<LINE>you have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
In summary, you cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because<LINE>you are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.<LINE>You are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I'm old.<LINE>I'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong!<LINE>I can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat a helpless<LINE>old man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon. But I have<LINE>no one to carry on the family tradition...
If I had a child like you,<LINE>my golden years would be carefree...
I wish my son were<LINE>as mature as you are.
I feel sad when I see a young and<LINE>bright child like you.
The first flush of youth...<LINE>You are too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...<LINE>I won't get them back.
Hey! It's me. It's me!<LINE>I am the best Pilot in the world!
How's that? Pwned!!
You! Who are you?!<LINE>Do you know who I am?
I'm at the top of the heap! I'm a man<LINE>who always wants to come in first.
Remember this! My favorite words<LINE>are "top of the heap."
You. Well done!<LINE>See you! I'll remember this!
I won't back down, lose, or fail!<LINE>No defeat for a Clerk ⑭.
Uh-huh!
Uuugh... Well done...<LINE>You made me fall to my knees...
I can do it! I can do anything!<LINE>I will do it! I will do it!
Yes! I did it! I can do it!<LINE>I can do it! I can doooooooo it!
But I listened to my Teacher's advice.<LINE>I can't lose! I can't!
My research will lead this world<LINE>to peace and happiness.
I am a genius. I will control<LINE>the future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed<LINE>to lose against someone like you...
Only research is left in my life.<LINE>I abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life<LINE>to research, is it?
Dedicating yourself to something<LINE>can cause loneliness.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... Please lend me<LINE>a hand for my experiment.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... I did it.<LINE>The experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...<LINE>This experiment was a failure...
You must face off against<LINE>my extremely powered-up Pokémon!
Well, this is a natural outcome.<LINE>The power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have even more awesome<LINE>strength than the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me<LINE>in my latest experiment!
Ho hi ho. You lost! You will help science<LINE>as my new assistant.
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up<LINE>as my new assistant.
Why do people compete and fight?<LINE>This is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your<LINE>opponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Foooooooooooo!
Eeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.<LINE>Pretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport<LINE>are the height of vileness...
Defeat is worth nothing.<LINE>Losers don't need words...
He-he-he. If you lose,<LINE>I will turn you into a Pokémon.
He-he-he. Well, from today on,<LINE>you are already a Pokémon.
Next time I see you, I will turn you<LINE>into a Pokémon with my power.
Argh... I have a headache...<LINE>I have such a headache...
I don't need psychic powers.<LINE>Please stop this headache...
If I don't keep using my power for battles,<LINE>my headache won't go away...
I claim that I am a Psychic,<LINE>but I cannot use psychic powers.
I am camouflaging it<LINE>with my Psychic-ish costume.
I go to magic classes<LINE>to look like a Psychic.
...Grrr... Yeeek!!<LINE>An evil spirit! Go away!!
OK! The evil spirit<LINE>that possessed you has disappeared.
Evil spirit!<LINE>Leave the Trainer at once!
I praise your courage for challenging me!<LINE>I am the one with the strongest kick.
Haha... I probably did not have to use<LINE>my strongest kick on you.
Oh... The Pokémon did the fighting.<LINE>My strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Suuup! I'll give it all I've got!<LINE>Let's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough!<LINE>Please value your life!
'Suuuuup! Good work. I tried everything<LINE>I could, but I'm disappointed.
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to impress me.<LINE>You can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's sad to say good-bye,<LINE>but we're running out of time.
Are you ready?<LINE>I'll take the gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league.<LINE>This is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost!<LINE>Who are you?!
I would like to do the fighting<LINE>instead of my Pokémon if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a<LINE>challenge. I want to make this personal.
Ah, I tingle with excitement.<LINE>I would like to fight...
Halt at once! You over there!<LINE>Let us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! <LINE>Please spare me. Please!
When I am surrounded by nature,<LINE>most other things cease to matter.
I won. But victory is nothing,<LINE>compared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness<LINE>of nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I am a city boy.<LINE>So I yearn for country life.
Do you have a hometown?<LINE>If so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a hometown to go back to,<LINE>'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature<LINE>and all Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order,<LINE>I will put them all in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!<LINE>Otherwise, I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect<LINE>Mother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich natural<LINE>environment and for the Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by<LINE>saving money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.<LINE>Let me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won<LINE>without your Pokémon.
You seem to be quite confident.<LINE>I'll sink you straight away.
I am devoting my body and soul<LINE>to Pokémon battles!
AAAAAAAAH! I am sooooo scared!<LINE>I will never do it again... Sorrrry!
I'm working very hard, but<LINE>that doesn't mean I am strong.
You're a strong Trainer,<LINE>so I think I was just lucky this time.
Even I can lose?!<LINE>But I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but<LINE>I became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have<LINE>clear goals. That's the way it goes.
I'm still not popular even though<LINE>I've been recognized as an Ace.
The lead character of this story...<LINE>I'll tell you who it is!
The lead character of the story is me!<LINE>You are just an extra!
Of course, you are the lead character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle<LINE>against the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time<LINE>on such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho-ho-ho! That is to our liking!<LINE>We find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and<LINE>fight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be<LINE>satisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well.<LINE>You can be an Ace Trainer.
I can see despair in your eyes.<LINE>Bring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.<LINE>You should start training all over again.
Did I underestimate you as just a little kid?<LINE>Or was this your true ability?
Hey, you, young Trainer.<LINE>I am utterly stylish, aren't I?
I am so stylish,<LINE>I hypnotize myself! Step back!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me.<LINE>It is hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you,<LINE>who doesn't know anything about battles.
After all, you are an amateur. No sweat.<LINE>(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?<LINE>Ha ha ha... I had no idea!
Argh. Cough, cough. I don't feel well.<LINE>Please show a little kindness.
I lied when I said I didn't feel well!<LINE>Veterans do anything to win!
You're very sharp!<LINE>You did not fall for my illness act.
I will give you a taste<LINE>of a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon?<LINE>Defeat is bitter, isn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.<LINE>And yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute!<LINE>Come, I promise to be nice in this battle.
You are so cute, really...<LINE>I want to see you again. I'll be waiting.
Your battle is a little too cute.<LINE>Let's play again sometime.
Oh, you are still a child.<LINE>Who said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature.<LINE>Come back when you've learned something.
I thought you were a child.<LINE>Hee hee... You are tough...
Don't call me a Veteran!<LINE>A woman's mind is always blooming.
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon.<LINE>I'll stay fit and ready all my life.
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and<LINE>my back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.<LINE>I have a lot of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack,<LINE>aren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!<LINE>Wait, my Bag has a hole...
I am not traveling for freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage,<LINE>but do you really need it?
My Bag is as wide as the sky.<LINE>In other words, my Bag is empty.
I haven't eaten anything for days.<LINE>Spots are floating before my eyes...
Those aren't spots floating before my eyes.<LINE>Those are glorious glimmers of victory!
Ah, I'm sinking fast. All I can think about<LINE>is where my next meal is coming from...
Neither my husband nor I have money,<LINE>so we are hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
Newly married, and such a big trip...<LINE>I'm worried about our future.
On top of that, I have lost track of him...<LINE>Where can he be wandering?
Hey! Hey! <LINE>Please check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that?<LINE>I'm proud of these Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that!<LINE>Please leave my Pokémon alone.
Being a Waiter is my disguise,<LINE>and it helps me live quietly.
On my days off, the real me is ready.<LINE>I'm an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living,<LINE>so I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.<LINE>I don't think I will lose.
Do you think you can win against me<LINE>with such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard.<LINE>It sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant<LINE>for Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will like<LINE>a full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon,<LINE>not a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Haroooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the mountain range of your life!<LINE>Cross me if you can!
Haha! I am the summit, and the road<LINE>to reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain!<LINE>This is my summit!
If I lose, I'll spill the secret of fishing.<LINE>If I win, I'll tell you the essence.
The essence of fishing is to pull<LINE>and reel in the fish--nothing else.
The secret of fishing is to wait without<LINE>thinking, as if you were dozing off.
I always aim for a big fish!<LINE>Stay out of this if you are a small fish!
Reeling you in was hard work.<LINE>You put up a good fight!
Oh! What a great hit!<LINE>Both my arms and heart are electrified!
You look kind of mature.<LINE>I like people like you.
Still, you look mature for your age.<LINE>Are you already an adult, or are you a kid?
A man with the heart of a boy<LINE>is just a wheedling child.
How much did this parasol cost?<LINE>Why, it is a cheap disposable.
I am a Parasol Lady, but I cannot<LINE>spend money for a parasol.
A parasol is just a tool. It’s fine<LINE>as long as it protects me from the rain.
I can really cut loose in Pokémon<LINE>battles without being scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why<LINE>Pokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya?<LINE>You are my pal.
My computer friends said I wouldn't be<LINE>taken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...<LINE>Maybe I am not cut out for this.
Eeek... I should have played<LINE>with my computer in my room.
My ride and I<LINE>are always together.
My ride helps me show off who I am.
My motorbike makes me feel better<LINE>when I lose.
I don't have money to buy gas,<LINE>so I have to push it with my feet.
I'm one of the Bikers,<LINE>so my bike is crucial.
Ah... Dad, Mom.<LINE>It's hard to be a Biker...
Aah, I am so hungry that I am<LINE>completely wiped out. What shall I do?
I'm working at a bakery, 'cause I want to<LINE>eat bread anytime I want.
Aah! I crashed from my sugar high!<LINE>Someone give me a pastry!
OK, I will do it! <LINE>I am excited about this!
Blast!
I'll remember this!
I'll confuse you with my smooth moves.<LINE>A-one, a-two, cha cha cha!
You could not focus on the battle,<LINE>'cause you were watching my smooth steps!
And one, and two, and twirl, and...<LINE>Ah, that didn't work at all! 
Sorry to keep you waiting.<LINE>Your idol, Harlequin, Harlequin.
Thank you very much.<LINE>It was Harlequin, Harlequin.
It was Harlequin, Harlequin.<LINE>Thank you for your support.
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.<LINE>I feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah.<LINE>I'm all achy...
I really feel blah.<LINE>Well, I will go home now.
A child like you cannot understand<LINE>the beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a servant of beauty.<LINE>Ugly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...<LINE>is you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon.<LINE>I am enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will be a good<LINE>memory as you grow older.
Experience hardships when you are young,<LINE>'cause old bodies cannot take them.
My schoolkids are sleeping.<LINE>I'm shooting for the top during nap time!
Oh, no!<LINE>Look at the time!
After nap time comes snack time.<LINE>I have to go back to preschool soon.
Life is full of so many farewells,<LINE>so I will enjoy the present.
I cannot see you again,<LINE>so I will do my best.
This is a woman's life.<LINE>Can a baby like you understand it?
If you work diligently,<LINE>you will get results.
You, keep trying.<LINE>Master the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,<LINE>things don't always go well.
I've arrived from a distant island.<LINE>May I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be <LINE>grateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon<LINE>that my wife is as mad as a hornet.
Pokémon battles are so much fun.<LINE>No way I can quit.
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife<LINE>is as scary as a legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days.<LINE>I gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me<LINE>from boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you,<LINE>I just melt.
I used to be like you.<LINE>I was full of hopes and dreams.
Dreams are important.<LINE>But if all you have is your dreamworld...
Just having hopes and dreams is not enough.<LINE>What is important is... Never mind.
I want to have an exhilarating battle.<LINE>Got it?
Thank you!<LINE>A battle is extremely exhilarating!
OK, OK, I got it...<LINE>Let's call it a day.
It's OK if I have training wheels.<LINE>It’s OK if my Bike doesn't accelerate.
It's OK if you go your own way.<LINE>You'll reach your goal someday.
It's OK if you lose.<LINE>It's OK, 'cause you have a Bicycle.
You ain't never even gonna see<LINE>my Pokémon's moves.
You're slow, ain't ya?
You're right quick! <LINE>Who are ya, anyways?
I just got married, and we'll be<LINE>expanding our family soon.
You know what I need.<LINE>Can you spare a few dollars?
Oh, I should really get home,<LINE>but Pokémon battles are so much fun...
Take a good look<LINE>at this Clerk ⑭'s sheer strength!
You got me!<LINE>You have the best skills in the world!
I put on a smile when I'm crying inside.<LINE>That's a Clerk ⑭'s sad smile.
I will show you the harsh side<LINE>of Pokémon battles.
That's not good.<LINE>I was too generous today.
Did you burn the image of my Pokémon<LINE>into your mind?
Who do you think I am?<LINE>I am a mighty Policeman!
That's for disobeying me!<LINE>I am a big guy!
You won a battle against a Policeman...<LINE>I will arrest you someday.
It's embarrassing, but I wasn't<LINE>well behaved when I was young.
You lack energy despite your youth.<LINE>Shall I train you?
Good, good. Misbehave while you're still<LINE>young and you can get away with it.
Squeak! Squeak, squeak, squeak...<LINE>Hm? What? Wanna fight?
You're so impatient.<LINE>I'm still in the middle of my work.
Ohh dear... You tracked dirt<LINE>on the floor I just finished cleaning...
There are only two roads in life.<LINE>The one you like, and the one you hate.
I'll choose the road I like,<LINE>even though it is not the quickest route.
Actually, the road you hate<LINE>may be the shortcut to your goal.
I am a train.<LINE>I will just run on the tracks.
You are a station where I don't stop.<LINE>I will just pass you by.
I think the train is great, because it runs<LINE>the same route over and over.
You're good at your job<LINE>and very strong.
I expected too much from you.<LINE>You are lucky that this is not business.
A person who can juggle<LINE>work and play is pretty cool.
I've been with these Pokémon<LINE>since I was a child.
Pokémon are like family to me.
I don't think I want to have children.<LINE>I'd rather focus on my Pokémon family.
Hi, I am a physician!<LINE>Hey! Let me give you a shot!
Come now, let me give you a shot!<LINE>Don’t worry. It won't hurt!
You have strong arms!<LINE>So let me give you a shot now!
Cough! Cough, cough! How many<LINE>more people will I be able to save?
Cough! I wanted to save more people.<LINE>Cough, cough!
Few physicians live well...<LINE>Cough! I can't go on any longer...
Do you want a shot?<LINE>Or an IV drip?
You want both a shot and an IV.<LINE>You are greedy!
Argh. It's sickening!<LINE>You're such a drip.
In this job,<LINE>I've seen a lot of strange things.
I don't know why, but Ghost-type <LINE>Pokémon seem attracted to me.
Ahhh, I lost... By the way,<LINE>who is that standing behind you?
I have raised them too long.<LINE>They are beyond my control...
It's over...<LINE>Nobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...<LINE>You saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon<LINE>you have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?<LINE>I expected more from you...
Wow! You are awesome!<LINE>What great Pokémon you've trained!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised<LINE>'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.<LINE>They're my friends and my treasures.
You are a strong one, sure enuff.<LINE>But I don't intend to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder.<LINE>I can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal, <LINE>aren't they?
They are too attached to me.<LINE>They are not fit for battling.
Arghhhh! Who is gentle?!<LINE>I will bring you down!
Arghh! Arghh! <LINE>I am NOT a Gentleman!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this!<LINE>I will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...<LINE>Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
What my brother told me was right...<LINE>Thanks... Bro...
I lost against a kid. Bro...<LINE>I should have listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just<LINE>because I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child,<LINE>but money makes the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits<LINE>I learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer.<LINE>I'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, bloom, and blossom!<LINE>A woman who flowers and triumphs!
I want to blossom and fall<LINE>rather than dying on the vine.
Hey, it's me. It's me!<LINE>I am the best Pilot in the world!
No! That's no good!<LINE>You cannot reach the top that way.
Good. You're daring!<LINE>I'll let you come fly on my plane.
Hey! Yo! It's me.<LINE>I am the best Pilot in the world.
Listen! A Trainer should be No. 1.<LINE>That's it!
You're quite a Trainer!<LINE>Be my apprentice!
