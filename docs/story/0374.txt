SKYLA: Oh, you came. Thank you!<LINE>I was right.<LINE>What I saw was a hurt POKéMON.<LINE>Don't worry, though!<LINE>It's fine now!<LINE>I gave it a Max Revive,<LINE>then it felt better and flew away!
Hee hee!<LINE>Don't I have great eyesight?<LINE>No matter how far away things are,<LINE>a Pilot's eyes can see them!
Oh, that's right! Since you've come<LINE>this far, why don't you ring the bell?<LINE>CELESTIAL TOWER's bell is for soothing<LINE>the spirits of POKéMON.<LINE>Also, the character of the person ringing<LINE>the bell is reflected in its sound.
SKYLA: Come on, don't be shy!
What a pretty sound.<LINE><PLAYER>, you are<LINE>a kind and strong person.<LINE><LINE>It's that kind of sound.
What a pretty sound.<LINE><PLAYER>, you are<LINE>a kind and strong person.<LINE><LINE>It's that kind of sound.
I'd like to introduce myself again!<LINE>I'm SKYLA, the LEADER of<LINE>MISTRALTON's POKéMON GYM.<LINE><LINE>I use Flying-type POKéMON.<LINE>When you are ready, please<LINE>come to the GYM.<LINE><LINE>I'll give you a big welcome!

<PLAYER> rang the bell…
The sound of the bell<LINE>reverberates through the area…
The sound of the bell<LINE>reverberates through the area…
The bell was left untouched…
ALDER: …
My old partner is resting<LINE>here in the CELESTIAL TOWER.<LINE>It was the first POKéMON<LINE>I received when I became a trainer.<LINE>I come here to ring the bell<LINE>and comfort its spirit.
It was a strong POKéMON.<LINE>It was courageous, noble, and kind…<LINE>Together, we madly pursued strength…<LINE>Without even knowing the meaning<LINE><LINE>of strength.
But, in the same way that all stories<LINE>have a beginning and an end,<LINE><LINE>all lives have an end, as well…<LINE>It was then that I understood that<LINE>strength isn't something that<LINE><LINE>remains unchanged forever.
However, the joy one feels in being with<LINE>POKéMON--that is the real thing.<LINE>In order to spread the word, I left<LINE>the POKéMON LEAGUE and kept traveling…<LINE>That's right! Traveling is wonderful.<LINE>I've met many different POKéMON,<LINE>many different trainers,<LINE><LINE>and now I've met all of you.
There are many more trainers and<LINE>POKéMON to encounter in the world!<LINE><PLAYER>! Go out and meet<LINE>as many of them as you can!
Well, <PLAYER>, I'll be waiting<LINE>for you at the POKéMON LEAGUE!
