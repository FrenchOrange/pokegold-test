This way, please!
Would you like to Dress Up your POKéMON?
What would you like me to explain?
What's the POKéMON Musical?
The POKéMON Musical is a show where<LINE>POKéMON wearing Props perform on stage.<LINE><LINE>Anyone can participate!<LINE>We encourage all trainers to show the<LINE>world how charming their POKéMON are!<LINE>The audience is looking forward to seeing<LINE>how you Dress Up your POKéMON, and how<LINE><LINE>your POKéMON perform!
How to Participate
You can join the musical from any of the<LINE>three reception areas.<LINE>The reception area in the center is for<LINE>participating alone.<LINE>When you participate alone, you will<LINE>be joined by other trainers from around<LINE><LINE>the UNOVA region.<LINE>If you want to put on a musical with your<LINE>friends, go to the left reception area.<LINE>You'll be asked to pick a LEADER who<LINE>will choose which show to perform,<LINE><LINE>and the others will join the group.<LINE>The reception area to the right is where<LINE>you go to Dress Up only.
Eligible POKéMON
The POKéMON that will participate in the<LINE>musical are chosen from your party at<LINE><LINE>the reception area.<LINE>Because of their shape, some POKéMON<LINE>have a hard time wearing certain Props.<LINE>You might want to try Dress Up in the<LINE>changing room first if you're worried!
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part! That's<LINE>where you put the Props you've collected<LINE><LINE>on the POKéMON that will be performing.<LINE>Depending on the POKéMON, you can put<LINE>the Props in different places.<LINE>When you use Props that fit the theme of<LINE>the show you've chosen, the audience<LINE><LINE>will notice your POKéMON more!<LINE>Sometimes a Prop that doesn't fit the<LINE>theme will also make your POKéMON<LINE><LINE>stand out.<LINE>If you want to get an idea of how it's<LINE>done, you can watch how other people<LINE><LINE>Dress Up and then try it yourself!
Shows
You can choose which show to perform<LINE>when you participate in the musical.<LINE>There is no need for trainers to give<LINE>commands, but if your POKéMON is carrying<LINE><LINE>a Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop<LINE><LINE>to show off and appeal to the audience.<LINE>Depending on how you Dress Up your<LINE>POKéMON, the reactions from the audience<LINE><LINE>will change!
