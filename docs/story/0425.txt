IRIS: Guess what!!<LINE>I can teach you the strongest<LINE>Dragon-type move!<LINE>Fun, huh? Want me to<LINE>teach your POKéMON this move?
OK! Well, if you change your mind,<LINE>come again, OK?
Let me see…<LINE>Well, this POKéMON can learn the move,<LINE>but you need to have a really strong<LINE><LINE>bond of friendship first.<LINE>I don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great!<LINE>Oh, but…<LINE>You don't seem to have a<LINE>POKéMON that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which POKéMON should<LINE>learn this move?
Um… I'm sorry…<LINE>That POKéMON can't learn this move!
What?<LINE>You want me to teach the move to an EGG?<LINE>OK, I'll do my best!<LINE>…<LINE>…<LINE>Sorry!<LINE>I think it's impossible!
This one?<LINE>Um, but…it looks like this POKéMON<LINE>already knows \xf000ć\x0001\x0000.
IRIS: Draco Meteor's power is<LINE>really amazing!<LINE>But after you use it, your Sp. Atk stat<LINE>goes down.

\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 learned<LINE>\xf000ć\x0001\x0001!
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 is trying to<LINE>learn \xf000ć\x0001\x0001!<LINE>But \xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 can't learn more than<LINE>four moves.<LINE>Delete a move to make room<LINE>for \xf000ć\x0001\x0001?
Give up on learning the<LINE>move \xf000ć\x0001\x0000?
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 did not learn \xf000ć\x0001\x0001!
Is it OK to forget the<LINE>move \xf000ć\x0001\x0000?
1, \xf000븂\x0001\x00142, and\xf000븂\x0001\x0014… \xf000븂\x0001\x0014… \xf000븂\x0001\x0014… Ta-da!\xf000븅\x0001\x0003\xf000븅\x0001\x0006<LINE>\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 forgot how to<LINE>use \xf000ć\x0001\x0001.<LINE>And…
\xf000Ă\x0001\x0000 learned \xf000ć\x0001\x0002!
DRAYDEN: If you wish, I can teach your<LINE>POKéMON the strongest<LINE><LINE>Dragon-type move.<LINE>Would you like your POKéMON to learn<LINE>that move?
Understood.<LINE>Come again if you change your mind.
Hmm…<LINE>This POKéMON can learn this move, but<LINE>your bond of friendship is not yet<LINE><LINE>strong enough.<LINE>That means I cannot teach<LINE>it this move.
I see…<LINE>But there are no POKéMON with<LINE>you right now that can learn this move.
Which POKéMON should<LINE>learn this move?
I'm very sorry, but…<LINE>This POKéMON cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but…<LINE>Not even I can teach a move to an EGG.
Hmm… It looks like this POKéMON<LINE>already knows \xf000ć\x0001\x0000.
DRAYDEN: Draco Meteor's power is<LINE>exceptional, but using it lowers<LINE><LINE>the user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought<LINE>you here…<LINE>Very well.<LINE>Let me reward your passion with some<LINE>absolutely astounding moves.<LINE>They're the ultimate moves!<LINE>Shall I teach them to<LINE>your POKéMON?

The POKéMON with you can't<LINE>learn these moves!<LINE>Go talk to my wife! Keh!!
Hmm… Well, that is fine, as well.<LINE>Visit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which POKéMON should I teach?
That POKéMON can't learn a move!<LINE>Go talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an EGG?<LINE>Impossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your POKéMON<LINE>is not strong enough! Keh!
That POKéMON already knows<LINE>that move! Keh!
I should teach \xf000ć\x0001\x0001 to<LINE><PLAYER>, right? Keh!

Heya!<LINE>The PROFESSOR gave you a POKéMON to<LINE>start your journey, right?<LINE>If that POKéMON is still with you, and if<LINE>you two have a strong bond, there's a<LINE><LINE>special move it can learn…<LINE>Want me to teach it a battle combo move?
A special move…<LINE>Should I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these POKéMON.
Is that so…<LINE>Well, come on back now, y'hear?
Which POKéMON should learn the move?
Now, that POKéMON can't learn this<LINE>special move!<LINE>I told ya, it's only for the POKéMON who<LINE>started your journey with you.
Teach a move to an EGG?<LINE>What kinda crazy talk is that?!
This POKéMON… Well, it doesn't look<LINE>like it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This POKéMON<LINE>already knows the special move!
Want me to teach \xf000ć\x0001\x0001<LINE>to <PLAYER>?
The POKéMON I've taken a shine to are<LINE>the ones you get from the PROFESSOR!<LINE>To teach all of these POKéMON a<LINE>special move, a battle combo move…<LINE><LINE>That's my pledge!
