Welcome to the STRIATON CITY<LINE>POKéMON GYM.

I'm CHILI! I light things up with<LINE>Fire-type POKéMON!
I'm a Water-type specialist,<LINE>and my name is CRESS.<LINE><LINE>Pleased to make your acquaintance.
And my name is CILAN.<LINE>I like Grass-type POKéMON.
CILAN: Um, you see…<LINE>As for why the three of us, um,<LINE>are all here is, well, er…
CHILI: Oh, enough! Listen up!<LINE>The three of us will<LINE>decide whom you'll battle!<LINE>It'll be based on the type of<LINE>the first POKéMON you chose!
CRESS: That is indeed the case.<LINE>And the partner you first chose was<LINE>\xf000ă\x0001\x0000 type, it seems.
Ta-da! The Fire-type scorcher CHILI--<LINE>that's me--will be your opponent!
That is correct!<LINE>It shall be I and my esteemed Water<LINE>types that you must face in battle!
Nothing personal… No hard feelings…<LINE>Me and my Grass-type POKéMON will…um…<LINE><LINE>We're gonna battle, come what may.
Yeeeeooow!<LINE>Time to play with FIRE!!<LINE>I'm the strongest of us brothers!
What incredible luck for you--you get to<LINE>battle the best among the three of us.
So, um, if you're OK with me, I'll, um,<LINE>put everything I've got into being, er,<LINE><LINE>you know, your opponent.
Aww, man!<LINE>I was all fired up, too!
How exceedingly lucky for you<LINE>that you do not have to face me.
…Uh hm. I always seem to lose<LINE>the timing of…of the dance. Like that.<LINE>True enough, I did want to…<LINE>want to have a POKéMON battle with you.
Whoa ho! You're on fire!<LINE>Well, it's the POKéMON LEAGUE's rule.<LINE>Take this GYM BADGE!
Why, you're quite remarkable.<LINE>It's the POKéMON LEAGUE's rule, so--<LINE>please take this BADGE.
…What a surprise.<LINE>You…are very strong.<LINE>Seems like not even<LINE>CHILI or CRESS could beat you…
<PLAYER> received<LINE>the Trio BADGE from CHILI!
<PLAYER> received<LINE>the Trio BADGE from CRESS!
<PLAYER> received<LINE>the Trio BADGE from CILAN!
GYM BADGES are proof<LINE>of a trainer's abilities.<LINE>If you have one BADGE, POKéMON, including<LINE>traded POKéMON up to Lv. 20,<LINE><LINE>will obey you without question.<LINE>We also want you to have this.
\xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000 contains Work Up.<LINE>If you use Work Up, the POKéMON's<LINE>Attack and Sp. Atk go up!<LINE>By the way, TMs can be used<LINE>as many times as you want.
In the UNOVA region, we are still<LINE>novice GYM LEADERs.<LINE>Which means the other GYM LEADERs<LINE>are much stronger than we are.<LINE><LINE>We'll need to work hard and improve.
I can't believe TMs can be used<LINE>over and over!<LINE>If you wanted, you could use one to<LINE>teach all your POKéMON the same move!
If there were 17 siblings in<LINE>the STRIATON CITY GYM…<LINE>There could be a specialist for<LINE>each type of POKéMON.
CILAN: In the UNOVA region, um,<LINE>we are still novice GYM LEADERs.<LINE>Which means, well, that other GYM<LINE>LEADERs are much stronger than we are.<LINE>Going…slow…and steady…is OK, so…<LINE>we compete with one another<LINE><LINE>and get, um, stronger and stronger.
CHILI: Oh! It's you!<LINE>Your fire is more intense than<LINE>when you got the Trio BADGE!
CRESS: …We heard about<LINE>the incident with N's CASTLE.<LINE>If we had received the message in time,<LINE>the three of us could have helped.
Hello! I'm Clyde. I'm the guide for<LINE>trainers challenging a POKéMON GYM.<LINE>We appreciate your challenging the GYM.<LINE>Take this to commemorate the occasion.
One basic element of POKéMON battles is<LINE>the relationship between types.<LINE>If you choose POKéMON with effective<LINE>types and effective moves,<LINE><LINE>victory is just a step away!<LINE>In this GYM, you proceed by<LINE>stepping on the switch with<LINE><LINE>the type that is effective against the<LINE><LINE>POKéMON type shown on the curtain.
I hope you'll always remember the<LINE>incredible moment when you received<LINE><LINE>this GYM BADGE.
Welcome!<LINE>We are very proud of our menu,<LINE>which we adjust to suit each trainer!
