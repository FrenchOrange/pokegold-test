Oh ho! With a face like that,<LINE>I'll bet you're a POKéMON trainer!<LINE>I work as a Depot Agent on the<LINE>Battle Subway!<LINE>Have you tried challenging the<LINE>Battle Subway yet?<LINE>It's a hot spot for those who want<LINE>some serious battling action!<LINE>But some people get too wrapped up<LINE>in their battles, and there's no end<LINE><LINE>to the lost-and-found items.<LINE>That's right. Nobody ever came to<LINE>pick this up, so I'll give it to you!
I have a lost-and-found item<LINE>that no one has claimed.<LINE>If you don't mind, could you take it<LINE>off my hands?
Oh! I've been waiting for you!<LINE>Recently, we've gotten more passengers,<LINE>so there's more lost-and-found items!<LINE>No one has claimed this, so if you don't<LINE>mind, could you take it off my hands?
No worries. No worries.<LINE>Just take it!<LINE>It's better for a trainer to use it than<LINE>for me to hold on to it.<LINE>I'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found<LINE>item, come get it, OK?<LINE>Also, if you're interested, take on the<LINE>Battle Subway in NIMBASA CITY!
Oh, my. There's no more room for<LINE>the \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0000.<LINE>You'll need to remove some from your BAG<LINE>before you can accept any more!
