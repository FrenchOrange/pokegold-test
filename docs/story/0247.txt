Oh, it's just a kid…
You… It couldn't be…<LINE>The fact that you are here means you<LINE>came to learn about the secret<LINE><LINE>of GENESECT!
We, TEAM PLASMA, revived GENESECT from<LINE>a fossil.<LINE>Then we enhanced the POKéMON with the<LINE>power of science!
It is the strongest POKéMON in history!!
But, our lord N was not interested in<LINE>this GENESECT that was modified by the<LINE><LINE>power of science!
'Science damages the natural beauty<LINE>of POKéMON! They're perfect beings!'
That's what he said…<LINE>So our research was halted, and this<LINE>facility was closed…
However!!<LINE>The GENESECT research is all mine!<LINE>So if you want to know GENESECT's<LINE>secret, you'll have to beat me in battle!
Battle the SCIENTIST?
I've lost everything…<LINE>I forgot my duty as a SCIENTIST is<LINE>to make the world happy.<LINE>So, this must be what I get for trying to<LINE>make a POKéMON into a tool for fighting…
I'm going to wash my hands of this<LINE>GENESECT matter…<LINE>I don't need this anymore…<LINE>I'll give it to you.
The item I just gave you was made<LINE>for GENESECT.<LINE>When it holds an item like this, it<LINE>becomes more powerful, but it ends up overwhelmed and goes berserk.
There sure are some very cowardly<LINE>trainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you the DRIVE.<LINE>Use it how you wish…
