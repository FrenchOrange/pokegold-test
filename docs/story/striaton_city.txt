Yes? Yes, I am a GYM LEADER of this town.<LINE>You are…?<LINE>Right. You want to challenge the GYM.<LINE>In that case…<LINE>What was the first POKéMON you chose?<LINE><PLAYER>… I see.

The scientist FENNEL was looking for you<LINE>a little while ago!
Wow!<LINE>It's a shiny GYM BADGE!<LINE>Getting that BADGE proved you have skill<LINE>enough to handle whatever comes next!
The STRIATON CITY GYM LEADER.<LINE>No matter how often I challenge him,<LINE>he always uses POKéMON<LINE><LINE>that I don't like…
If a POKéMON type and a move type are<LINE>the same, the move's power will increase!<LINE><LINE>The GYM LEADER told me!
At the site of an old factory,<LINE>at a place we call the DREAMYARD,<LINE><LINE>there's an unusual POKéMON<LINE><LINE>that can make dreams appear!
I too studied at the Trainers' School<LINE>when I was a beginner.
Do you know how Technical Machines work?<LINE>A TM can instantly teach a move to a<LINE>POKéMON. You can use it over and over<LINE><LINE>with different POKéMON. How cool is that?
Er… Um…<LINE>Grass-type POKéMON are<LINE>weak against Fire-type moves.<LINE>I know more stuff!
Er… Um…<LINE>Water-type POKéMON are<LINE>weak against Grass-type moves.<LINE>I know more stuff!
Um… Er…<LINE>Fire-type POKéMON are<LINE>weak against Water-type moves.<LINE>I know more stuff!
Some Trainers train themselves and<LINE>their POKéMON in the DREAMYARD.<LINE>You might think about going there…<LINE>Could be you'll find something…
I'm so glad you came.<LINE>I'd like to give you this!
To live quietly and do a lot of fishing…<LINE>I truly live my ideal existence!
POKéMON can be found in dark places, too.<LINE>That's when a Dusk Ball can do the trick!<LINE><LINE>Here's one for you.
A Dusk Ball works well at night<LINE>or in a cave.<LINE>Plus, its name is excellent!<LINE>The Dusk Ball. Dusk!
