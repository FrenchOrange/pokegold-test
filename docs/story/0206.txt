CHEREN: <PLAYER>!<LINE>Since we both hold the Jet BADGE now,<LINE>let's see which of us is stronger!
ALDER: That was a fine POKéMON battle!<LINE>I'm happy to see you are both growing<LINE>as trainers!
CHEREN: If it isn't the Champion, ALDER.<LINE>I'm weak, so I lost!<LINE>…And, honestly, it bothers me when you<LINE>call it a fine battle despite that.
ALDER: Oh, honestly, CHEREN.<LINE>Just accept the compliment without the<LINE>stinging remark.<LINE>I've asked you this before, but what do<LINE>you plan to do after becoming strong?
CHEREN: If I get strong and become a<LINE>Champion, that will be the reason for<LINE><LINE>my existence.<LINE><LINE>I want to prove that I'm really living.
ALDER: Hmmm…<LINE>You remind me of MARSHAL.<LINE>Of course, having something you want<LINE>to become is important.<LINE>But what is even more important is<LINE>what you do with your newfound power.<LINE>Anyway, take this!
Here--you, too.
ALDER: If you use the move Surf, you can<LINE>travel over water.<LINE>I shall see you again, young trainers.<LINE>Don't forget about the needs of the<LINE>POKéMON at your side!
CHEREN: What I do with my power…<LINE>I don't know that answer yet. First, I<LINE>want to become a strong trainer so<LINE><LINE>everyone will acknowledge that power!
<PLAYER>…<LINE>Next time, I will win!
