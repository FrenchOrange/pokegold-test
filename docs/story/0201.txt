Zinzolin: All of you--huddle around me!<LINE>I can't take this cold…
CHEREN: Whatever.<LINE>I can't believe you were really hiding.<LINE>It's a bother, but if you're cold,<LINE>shall I show you outside?
Zinzolin: POKéMON are our king's friends.<LINE>While we're taking care of them, we can't<LINE>let any harm come to them here.<LINE>Everyone, drive these intruders away!
TEAM PLASMA: Understood,<LINE>Zinzolin of the Seven Sages!<LINE>Put 'em up, 'cause here we come!
CHEREN: <PLAYER>!<LINE>Let's each take care of one side!
CHEREN: <PLAYER>, you take<LINE>care of those guys over there!
TEAM PLASMA: I'm one of the tougher<LINE>members of TEAM PLASMA here!
TEAM PLASMA: How am I supposed to win<LINE>when I'm shaking 'cause of the cold?
TEAM PLASMA: S-s-so cold…<LINE>How can I win when I'm shivering so hard?
TEAM PLASMA: For this group,<LINE>I'm pretty strong. I hope you know that!
TEAM PLASMA: In the middle of the night,<LINE>we gathered all the POKéMON we stole<LINE><LINE>in front of the container, so we could<LINE><LINE>transport them all at the same time.<LINE>Then CLAY, that old guy, found us.<LINE>We had been captured!
TEAM PLASMA: In the middle of the night,<LINE>we gathered all the POKéMON we stole<LINE><LINE>in front of the container, so we could<LINE><LINE>transport them all at the same time.<LINE>Then CLAY, that old guy, found us.<LINE>We had been captured!
TEAM PLASMA: In this group,<LINE>I'm fairly strong, and that's a fact!
TEAM PLASMA: The POKéMON that work<LINE>with people may look like they're having<LINE><LINE>fun, but the truth is they're suffering.<LINE>There's no doubt about it!
TEAM PLASMA: The POKéMON that work<LINE>with people may look like they're having<LINE><LINE>fun, but the truth is they're suffering.<LINE>There's no doubt about it!
TEAM PLASMA: In my own way, I'm a strong<LINE>part of this TEAM PLASMA group!
TEAM PLASMA: Hmm-mmm… I wonder why…<LINE>I'm getting sleepy for some reason.
TEAM PLASMA: I wonder why…<LINE>I'm getting sleepy for some reason.

TEAM PLASMA: Um.<LINE>Running into the COLD STORAGE,<LINE><LINE>thinking it was a regular container…<LINE><LINE>How cold life can be…
TEAM PLASMA: Me?<LINE>Losing to a trainer like this?!
TEAM PLASMA: Achoo! Why did I end up<LINE>here when I'm allergic to the cold!
CLAY: Well, I'll be!<LINE>Hidin' in a chilly old place like this…
You guys take these<LINE>POKéMON robbers!
Worker: Roger!
Come on!
Eek!
Ugh!
CLAY: You guys ain't so bad!<LINE>Yup, a promise is a promise.<LINE>Come on an' challenge my GYM!
CHEREN: Whatever…<LINE>TEAM PLASMA's ideal…<LINE>Separating people and POKéMON…<LINE>It's exactly the same as not having<LINE>POKéMON in this world at all.<LINE><LINE>That bunch is a waste of oxygen.<LINE><PLAYER>…<LINE>It's cold, so I'm getting out of here.
Zinzolin: So, you returned?<LINE>You're an odd trainer.<LINE>All right. I've got time enough<LINE>to satisfy your curiosity.
…Breathing.<LINE>Having a heart that beats.<LINE>That is simple existence and<LINE>nothing more for a living being.<LINE>That may be the definition of living,<LINE>but I don't think that defines life.
The experiences of joy and suffering<LINE>are a vital part of being alive.<LINE>GHETSIS gave me the sensation<LINE>of being truly alive…<LINE>What did he mean to accomplish?<LINE>That isn't what's important.
Right now, I'm shivering.<LINE>I'm suffering, but I'm alive.
POKéMON and people live by being<LINE>together and relying on one another.<LINE><LINE>That might be how you feel.<LINE>If that's so, is it necessary to<LINE>separate people and POKéMON?<LINE>By talking to you, I've discovered that<LINE>there's much I need to think about…<LINE>I wish I had more to give you in thanks…<LINE>Here, take this.
Zinzolin: My lord N said that he wanted<LINE>to make POKéMON perfect…<LINE>But, even if the relationship between<LINE>POKéMON and people stayed as it now is,<LINE><LINE>POKéMON can aspire to perfection…
LOOKER: Indeed! I am an officer of the<LINE>International Police, and I demand to<LINE><LINE>hear all you know about TEAM PLASMA!
Zinzolin: It's too cold and I'm already<LINE>tired of shivering in here.<LINE>If you'll give me some time to think,<LINE>I'll tell you what I know.<LINE><LINE>So…take me with you.
LOOKER: Thanks many times over!<LINE>Now, GHETSIS notwithstanding, there<LINE>yet remains but \xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the<LINE><LINE>Seven Sages still at large.<LINE>The thoughts they are contemplating,<LINE>the hopes they are anticipating,<LINE><LINE>these--these are what I want to know!<LINE><LINE>Until our next meeting!
LOOKER: Thank you!<LINE><PLAYER>, of something we must speak.<LINE>A report has reached my ears of someone<LINE>far from here. Indeed, this someone<LINE><LINE>has spotted a person like N and a…<LINE><LINE>dragon POKéMON.<LINE>I plan to examine the exactitude<LINE>of this information. <LINE><LINE>I hope to see you again!
