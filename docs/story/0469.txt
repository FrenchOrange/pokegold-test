Have you noticed it's been getting<LINE>warmer out lately? It's really nice.<LINE>Hey, want to hang out for a while?<LINE>If you have time, we could have a battle.<LINE>Sound good?
All right! Lucky me, meeting<LINE>a cool dude like you here.<LINE>Let's battle right now!
Eep, my bad.<LINE>I shouldn't have sprung that on you.<LINE>Sorry! Forget I asked!
Wow! <PLAYER>,<LINE>you are so good at POKéMON battles!<LINE>I want to ask you something else…<LINE>Will you ride the Ferris wheel with me?<LINE>I bet I get just as nervous asking a guy<LINE>as a guy would asking a girl…<LINE>You're OK with that, right? Good! C'mon!
Woo, that was fun! I've been wanting to<LINE>ride this Ferris wheel for a long time.<LINE>But you have to have two people,<LINE>and I worried that if I went with my<LINE><LINE>friend, she'd see how scared I was.<LINE><LINE>Embarrassing!<LINE>Then you came along!<LINE>How lucky is that?<LINE>OK, I'm still scared of heights, but…<LINE>With you, it was a little bit easier.<LINE>Um… Want to ride it again?
Hi, <PLAYER>! How are you?<LINE>Want to hang out for a little while?<LINE>We could have a POKéMON battle<LINE>and ride the Ferris wheel together!<LINE>This time, I kinda think<LINE>I won't get scared!
Hee hee hee. Awesome!<LINE><PLAYER>, let's have a<LINE>POKéMON battle right now!
Oh. Oh well, that's how it goes.<LINE>You do look kinda busy, <PLAYER>.
Boy oh boy! <PLAYER>,<LINE>you are so good at POKéMON battles.<LINE>No matter what I tried, it was all you!<LINE>I'm done with POKéMON battles.<LINE>So, shall we…ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>Eep, don't give me that look! I'll be fine!<LINE><LINE>I'm calm, cool, and collected.<LINE><LINE>Going to be absolutely fine this time!<LINE>Uh-huh…
Aww… That was scary again.<LINE>But, you know, <PLAYER>, when I'm with<LINE>you, I can almost enjoy being scared.<LINE>It's like you make it safe anyway.<LINE>Ha ha, maybe I'm weird.<LINE>I like hanging out with you, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'm looking forward to seeing you again!
It sure is getting nice out.<LINE>The warmer it gets, the sleepier I feel!<LINE>Oh, hey, do you have a minute?<LINE>I want to ride the Ferris wheel, but it's<LINE>two at a time, so I can't go by myself.<LINE>You don't mind riding with me, do you?<LINE>I don't have anything to give you in<LINE>exchange, but I've got a great<LINE><LINE>POKéMON I've been raising, so we<LINE><LINE>could at least have an awesome battle.
You serious? Aww, thanks!<LINE>You're awesome!<LINE>Let me introduce my POKéMON. It rocks!
OK… Sorry to have bothered you.<LINE>I'll find somebody who's not in a rush.<LINE>Have a good one!
Er, <PLAYER>? Did I get that right?<LINE>You rocked the house!<LINE>I know I might not look it, but among<LINE>my crowd, I've never lost a battle!<LINE>Here I was thinking you're just cute, and<LINE>then, seriously, you ruled the battle!<LINE>That's even cooler!<LINE>Right! Let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!
Wh-what?<LINE>Why are you asking if something's wrong?<LINE>I'm OK! I'm OK!<LINE>It's all…good.<LINE>Anyway, thanks, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I figured the Ferris wheel was kid stuff.<LINE>The view was great…<LINE>Gave me the shivers…<LINE>I guess this ride is not too bad<LINE>once in a while.<LINE>In fact, let's ride it again sometime!<LINE>See ya, <PLAYER>!
Oh, hi, <PLAYER>!<LINE>W-wanna hang out…maybe…<LINE>Feel like…having a POKéMON battle…and<LINE>riding the Ferris wheel?
Did you say y-yes? Seriously!<LINE>Cool!<LINE>I knew you were awesome<LINE>the minute I saw you!<LINE>Ready to battle? Let's go!
Oh…<LINE>Sorry.<LINE>Well, when you're free,<LINE>give me a shout sometime.<LINE><LINE>See ya, <PLAYER>!
Ugh, ugh, ugh. As usual,<LINE>you showed no mercy on me.<LINE>Have you thought about trying<LINE>to become the Champion?<LINE><PLAYER>, I think that<LINE>could be more than a dream for you.<LINE>And I'll cheer you all the way!<LINE>Yeah. Anyway…<LINE>Let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!
Hmm-mmmm… Hm, hm, hmm…<LINE>Ah, sorry, sorry…<LINE>I was just thinking.<LINE>I feel like… <LINE>When I am hanging out with you,<LINE><LINE>time passes sooooo fast.<LINE><LINE>I mean, I was thinking…<LINE><LINE>How cruel time can be.<LINE>Ha ha, forget I said anything!<LINE>Thanks for the fun! Let's hang out again!<LINE>Bye, <PLAYER>!
Hi, trainer. Enjoying the summer?<LINE>It's sure hot today.<LINE>That's summer for ya.<LINE>What? You wanna ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE><LINE>It's for two at a time, so take a friend.<LINE>What? You want me to ride it with you?<LINE>Sure, I guess. I'll ride with ya…<LINE><LINE>But you gotta win a POKéMON battle!
Sure enough.<LINE>A little battle practice is a good way<LINE>to spend a summer's day.
Oh well. Didn't feel like wasting my time<LINE>riding a Ferris wheel anyway.
Nice job. I'm impressed.<LINE>You and your POKéMON make a great team.<LINE><LINE>Thanks, that was fun. See ya!<LINE>What?<LINE>That's not what I promised?<LINE><LINE>You still want to ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>OK, sure enough, I guess…
It…uh…it was fun…<LINE>Yeah, great view…<LINE>What? I wasn't looking at the view?<LINE>I was looking at my feet the whole time?<LINE><LINE>What are you talking about?<LINE>You think I'm scared of heights?<LINE>Nah. That would be lame.<LINE>I hike on mountains way higher than<LINE>a silly little Ferris wh-wheel.<LINE>C-catch ya later, trainer!
Oh. You again.<LINE>Summer's about over, you know.<LINE>Time to put the hiking boots away. Wait…<LINE>You want to ride the Ferris wheel again…<LINE>Er…<LINE>I guess…
If you want me to ride the Ferris wheel,<LINE>you have to win a POKéMON battle first.<LINE>What? Don't be ridiculous!<LINE>It's not an excuse. Why would I need an<LINE><LINE>excuse? No Hiker is scared of heights!
Oh, you changed your mind? Ha ha ha.<LINE>Well, don't feel bad if you're scared.<LINE><LINE>Lots of people are scared of heights.<LINE>No need to be embarrassed about that.<LINE>Me? Scared? Ya think? Me, a Hiker?<LINE><LINE>I'm all that and a slice of pie. Got it?<LINE><LINE>Good. S-see ya!
Y'know, kid, I figured you'd have<LINE>POKéMON that were strong and tough!<LINE><LINE>You're gonna be a big success!<LINE>Yep, that was a fun battle. See ya!<LINE>Wha…?<LINE>You still wanna ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>Er…<LINE>OK, let's go.<LINE><LINE>Sigh…
I-it was… It was fun, eh?<LINE>What? I what? I fainted?!<LINE><LINE>Don't be ridiculous!<LINE>I'm a Hiker!<LINE>I'm not scared of heights.<LINE>The only reason I was on the floor<LINE>was because there was gum on my shoe.<LINE>That's it, kid. I'm out! See ya!
I can't believe how hot it is! Can you?<LINE>Say, are you interested in the Ferris<LINE>wheel? I'm here for the same thing!<LINE>The Ferris wheel seats two people,<LINE>so, unfortunately, you can't ride alone.<LINE>Let me think. Say, why don't you have<LINE>a POKéMON battle with me?<LINE>If you win the battle,<LINE>I wouldn't mind riding with you.<LINE>What do you say? Battle on?
Sure, sure…<LINE>I'm interested in you because you seem<LINE>to be so drawn to the Ferris wheel.<LINE>That being said, I am an Ace trainer.<LINE>I won't compromise in battle.
All right. Just as well for you…
Gah. I hate to admit it…<LINE>Losing to you is a complete surprise.<LINE>Sigh…<LINE>Looks can be deceiving, so they say…<LINE>Fair enough. As I said earlier,<LINE>I'll ride the Ferris wheel with you.<LINE>Actually, it's my first Ferris wheel ride.
I had no idea.<LINE>Call me stupid, but I didn't know<LINE>how scary altitude could be.<LINE>And…now I know.<LINE>Thanks to you.<LINE><LINE>I mean, thank you.<LINE><LINE>Thank you for staying calm.<LINE>Let me ask you something…<LINE>Let's keep the whole altitude thing<LINE><LINE>between you and me.<LINE>And then, if you really want to ride the<LINE>Ferris wheel again, I'll ride with you.<LINE>Being an Ace trainer means finding<LINE>a way to conquer my fear.
Ah. H-hi.<LINE>You're calling me out to ride<LINE>the Ferris wheel again?<LINE>You see how I'm acting like it's the<LINE>simplest thing for me to conquer my fear?<LINE>You can help me out. We'll battle.<LINE>You win, and I'll ride the Ferris wheel<LINE>with you again.<LINE>Do you believe in me?
I knew it!<LINE>I knew you would bet on me!<LINE>If I didn't try to conquer this fear,<LINE>then I really would be stupid.<LINE><LINE>Let's get going!
I'm letting myself down here.<LINE>This was a chance for me<LINE>to conquer my weakness…<LINE><LINE>to change my attitude about altitude…
My sincerest thanks for calling me out.<LINE>I'd be a fool to hang on to this fear.<LINE>When you believe in me,<LINE>I believe in myself and in my ability<LINE><LINE>to become a truly fearless Ace trainer.<LINE>It's all up to me… Watch it happen!
What are you grinning for?<LINE>Am I imagining it, or are you<LINE>laughing at me?<LINE><LINE>Nice. Nice… Well, thanks for nothing.<LINE>I am absolutely sure I will probably<LINE>conquer my fear when the time comes.<LINE><LINE>Because I am an Ace trainer!<LINE>But for now, I'm out.<LINE>But if you keep thinking about riding<LINE><LINE>the Ferris wheel with me again, and you<LINE><LINE>just can't help yourself, come find me.
It's autumn already.<LINE>Summer goes by so fast…<LINE>Do you know what I mean?<LINE>See the Ferris wheel?<LINE>I've ridden it so many times,<LINE>but now, summer's almost over<LINE><LINE>and everyone's gone away…<LINE>Gone to school, gone on journeys.<LINE>And I'm still here, all alone.<LINE>I'd like to ride one more time,<LINE>but I need a friend to ride with.<LINE>Do me a favor and ride with me?<LINE>In return,<LINE><LINE>I'll do my best in a POKéMON battle.
Aww. Ha ha. Thank you, young man.<LINE>You have a kind heart.<LINE>Well, let's have a POKéMON battle!<LINE>Look out! I'll show you how it's done!
I see. Pardon me for being so out there.<LINE>I'm sorry for intruding on you,<LINE><LINE>a stranger…
Whoops… That seemed like an easy win!<LINE>I did my best, though.<LINE>Ha ha. Thanks for the lesson!<LINE>It was fun.<LINE>Well, now…<LINE>Ready to ride the Ferris wheel?
Boo-hoo…<LINE>This view reminds me of so many things…<LINE>Sniff… Oh… I'm fine, I'm fine…<LINE>Oh…<LINE>I don't even know your name.<LINE>Well, do you mind my asking…?<LINE>Your name is <PLAYER>… Nice name.<LINE>I'll be around here for a while.<LINE>If you don't mind, I'd be happy if you<LINE><LINE>rode the Ferris wheel with me again.
Oh, it's you. Hi.<LINE>How have you been?<LINE>Are you here to ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>I'd love to go again…<LINE>We could have another POKéMON battle…
I'm so glad… Thank you…<LINE>Your kindness really lifts my spirits.<LINE>I know you're probably on your way<LINE>somewhere. Everyone's always busy.<LINE><PLAYER>, ready for my best battle?<LINE>Let's see how it goes this time!
Whoops, I thought you looked too busy.<LINE>Sorry to have stopped you.<LINE>See you…
Oh, my. <PLAYER>,<LINE>you are really good at POKéMON battles.<LINE>A battle with me is not<LINE>challenging enough, is it?<LINE>But you've been kind enough to battle<LINE>with me anyway.<LINE><LINE>I wish I had a…a little brother like you.<LINE>Sorry, I'm just thinking out loud.<LINE>Come on, let's ride the Ferris wheel<LINE>again! I can't wait!
Boo-hoo… <PLAYER>,<LINE>your kindness has meant a lot to me.<LINE>I don't know why I'm telling you this,<LINE>but I wish I had a little brother like you.<LINE><PLAYER>, I feel so alone these days.<LINE>Thanks for spending time with me.<LINE>I don't know if I'll see you again…<LINE>I hope so, <PLAYER>! See you!
It's kinda getting cool…<LINE>I betcha it's gonna get cold soon.<LINE>Are you here to ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>Me, too.<LINE>But you've gotta have two people.<LINE>What do you wanna do?<LINE>How about we have a POKéMON battle?<LINE>Win, and I'll ride the wheel with you.
Just like that, you say yes?<LINE>You're kinda confident, hey?<LINE>Whatever…<LINE>One battle will show what's what.<LINE>Let's see what you got on your plate!
Ack. Whatever.<LINE>I'll be around a while if you<LINE>change your mind.
Whew… I was no match for you.<LINE>Guess I was the one who was kinda<LINE>more confident than I should have been!<LINE>I figured I knew my POKéMON battles, but<LINE>you showed me what is really what!<LINE>OK, like I said, one ride on the<LINE>Ferris wheel--over easy.
Haah! It was so relaxing to talk with you!<LINE>It felt great to really let my hair down<LINE>and have some girl talk for a change.<LINE>That's what I think--sometimes you need<LINE>another girl to talk to, and that's that.<LINE>Hey, I'm gonna hang out here for a bit!<LINE>If you feel like it, stop by and we'll talk<LINE>some more!
Hey! We met the other day!<LINE>Glad to see you! How're you doing?<LINE>If you're not busy, let's hang out again.<LINE>Why don't we have a POKéMON battle<LINE>and chat while riding the Ferris wheel?
Yeah? You good? Yeah!<LINE>For whatever reason, hanging out<LINE>with you energized me like whoa!<LINE>Ooh, let's have a POKéMON battle first!
Aww. Oh well, if you gotta motor…<LINE>We'll have another chance to catch up<LINE><LINE>sometime. Say hi next time, OK?
Sigh… I lost…again!<LINE>You've got a knack for<LINE>handling POKéMON, too.<LINE><LINE>I'm just not in your LEAGUE.<LINE>And you're smart and pretty and nice…<LINE>I gotta say, I'm totally jealous of you!<LINE>Come on, at least we can ride the<LINE>Ferris wheel together.
Aww… It's over already! I knew it.<LINE>When I hang out with you,<LINE>time just seems to zip by!<LINE>I probably shouldn't say this,<LINE>but I don't have a lot of friends…<LINE>So finding someone to do stuff with and,<LINE>you know, just talk and stuff…<LINE><LINE>Well, it's really important to me!<LINE>Um, thanks for being someone<LINE>I can talk to.<LINE>Anytime you wanna hang out, let me know!
It's already cold out.<LINE>It would be so fun if it snowed.<LINE>What's the matter?<LINE>Do you wanna go for a ride?<LINE>Oh, I get it.<LINE>You can't ride 'cause<LINE>you're all by yourself!<LINE>They don't let you ride this<LINE>Ferris wheel by yourself.<LINE>Hey! I know what!<LINE>I thought of something!<LINE>I don't have anything to do<LINE>until my dad comes back…<LINE>We could play and have a<LINE>POKéMON battle, if you want?<LINE>If you play with me, then we<LINE>can both ride the Ferris wheel!
You do? You want to play with me?<LINE>Hee hee! I'm happy!<LINE>Fun! Fun! Let's battle!
You don't want to play?<LINE>Aww. I'm bored!
That was fun! Thank you!<LINE>I knew you'd be strong<LINE>'cause you're big!<LINE>My dad is very strong in<LINE>POKéMON battles, too!<LINE>But, he's been busy working,<LINE>so he doesn't play with me.<LINE>But you're gonna play with me!<LINE>Next, let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Yay! That was cool!<LINE>Did you have fun?<LINE>It's been a while since I had fun.<LINE>My dad doesn't take me anywhere lately.<LINE>He just comes home and sleeps.<LINE>So, I try to have fun here by myself<LINE>until my dad comes back.<LINE>Let's play some more!
<PLAYER>!<LINE>I have a lot of time!<LINE>Do you have time to play, too?<LINE>Let's play!<LINE>And let's have a POKéMON battle!<LINE><LINE>And let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Tee hee! Yay! Thank you!<LINE><PLAYER>!<LINE>Um, OK…<LINE>First, let's have a POKéMON battle!
Booo!<LINE>Are you busy?<LINE>All grown-ups are busy.<LINE>I am soooooo bored…
Tee hee! That was so fun!<LINE><PLAYER>, you're really strong!<LINE>I bet you're stronger than my dad<LINE>in POKéMON battles!<LINE>Um, OK, next!<LINE>The Ferris wheel! The Ferris wheel!<LINE>Hurry up! Let's go!
Hee hee! That was fun!<LINE>You had fun, too. Right? Right?<LINE><PLAYER>, you know what?<LINE>I like you 'cause you play with me!<LINE>And! You know what else?<LINE>Um, it's… I don't like my dad lately.<LINE>My dad and me, we're alone.<LINE>I know he's working hard, but…<LINE>I don't like my dad 'cause<LINE>he doesn't play with me or anything.<LINE>I want him to play with me more.<LINE>Wait!<LINE>You'll play with me again, right?<LINE>Right?<LINE>OK. See ya! Bye-bye!
Hi…<LINE>Pretty chilly out, don't you think?<LINE>Er… Well…<LINE>I was wondering if you'd think about…<LINE>Actually, this is the first time I've been<LINE>out of the house in a long time.<LINE>Since I'm out anyway, I want to get<LINE>some exercise for my POKéMON.<LINE>And I want to ride the Ferris wheel, too.<LINE>So… Want to keep me company?
Really? Yes? OK!<LINE>Thanks!<LINE>You seem like a nice person.<LINE>Let's start by giving our POKéMON<LINE>a little warm-up battle for exercise.
OK. Totally understand.<LINE>Didn't mean to intrude on your time.
Pant, pant… I'm crushed! It's been way<LINE>too long since I got enough exercise.<LINE>But…<LINE>It was fun!<LINE>My POKéMON also looks pretty happy,<LINE>thanks to the exercise.<LINE>Thank you for having a battle with us.<LINE>Now, shall we ride the Ferris wheel?<LINE>I've been looking forward to this<LINE>for a long time.
<PLAYER>, thank you.<LINE>I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.<LINE>I don't get out much.<LINE>My health has never been strong.<LINE>It's been tremendous hanging out<LINE>with you today…<LINE>So, thanks again, <PLAYER>.<LINE>When I feel well enough, I'll be back.<LINE>I'd love to hang out with you again.
Hello, <PLAYER>. Good to see you!<LINE>It's cold, eh? How are you doing?<LINE>I feel good today, so I'm out for a walk.<LINE>If you don't mind, <PLAYER>,<LINE>it would be nice to have a POKéMON battle<LINE><LINE>and ride the Ferris wheel together…<LINE>Let's hang out for a while,<LINE>if that sounds good?
All right! I like that answer!<LINE>Shall we begin with a little<LINE>POKéMON exercise?
I see, alas. You are a busy person.<LINE>When you have time, it would be nice<LINE>to talk with you again.
Pant, pant…<LINE>Still…<LINE>Still…don't have the physical strength<LINE>to keep up with you…<LINE>But it's fun<LINE>to have a battle…<LINE>My POKéMON's also<LINE>glad to see you.<LINE>Thank you…<LINE>Shall we ride the Ferris wheel now?<LINE>Let's be on our way, <PLAYER>…
Again, sorry if I've caused you trouble.<LINE>But, <PLAYER>, since I started<LINE>hanging out with you, I feel better…<LINE>And, to be honest, <PLAYER>,<LINE>I am very happy to hang out with you.<LINE>As long as you don't mind, I'd enjoy<LINE>having you hang out with me another time.<LINE>Again, thank you very much for today.<LINE>See you, <PLAYER>…
