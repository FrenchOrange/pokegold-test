TEAM PLASMA: Gramps! We know you run<LINE>the DAY-CARE!<LINE>How do we know?<LINE>Because we're TEAM PLASMA!
TEAM PLASMA: We are taking POKéMON away<LINE>from people.<LINE>Since you work at the DAY-CARE, we figure<LINE>you must have a lot of POKéMON!<LINE><LINE>Hand 'em over!
Day-Care Man: What kind of<LINE>nonsense is this?!
Oh! A strong-looking Trainer!<LINE>Please help me!
TEAM PLASMA: If you're going to get in<LINE>our way, we'll take your POKéMON, too!
TEAM PLASMA: !!
TEAM PLASMA: This went downhill fast!<LINE>So I think… We'd better… Ruuuun!<LINE>Let's hide out at the amusement park!
Day-Care Man: Thank you so much!<LINE>Please take this as a token<LINE>of my gratitude.<LINE>It's a brand-new Bike.<LINE>I'd always planned on riding around<LINE><LINE>NIMBASA CITY…<LINE><LINE>But I never ended up riding it.
Day-Care Man: I have a DAY-CARE<LINE>on ROUTE 3!<LINE>If you have any POKéMON you want<LINE>me to raise, please drop them off!<LINE>I just came to sightsee, but<LINE>I got in a lot of trouble!
BIANCA: Hey, <PLAYER>! Yoo-hoo!
BIANCA: <PLAYER>! Know what?
The professor told me NIMBASA CITY<LINE>has a lot of things to see and do--<LINE>the amusement park, Big Stadium,<LINE>Small Court, and the Battle Subway!
I'm going to go see the POKéMON Musical!<LINE>See you later!
BIANCA: Yoo-hoo, <PLAYER>!
BIANCA: <PLAYER>! Know what?
I just had a look at the Musical Theater.<LINE>It's sooo cool!<LINE>Since you're here, come on, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Come with me!<LINE>Over here, over here!
OK, we're here! Let's go in!
BIANCA: Ooh, <PLAYER>!<LINE>Are you interested in musicals?<LINE>Then, let's go in together!
BIANCA: Daddy?!<LINE>What are you doing here?
BIANCA's Dad: I've come to take you<LINE>back home, of course!<LINE>Your mother told me that you'd<LINE>made it all the way out here.<LINE>Haven't you gone far enough?
BIANCA: No way!<LINE>I'm going to keep traveling<LINE>with <PLAYER> and my POKéMON!
BIANCA's Dad: Absolutely not! Others do<LINE>things their way, and we do things ours!
BIANCA: Is that so?<LINE>Then, how about you do things your way,<LINE>and I'll do things mine!
Sweetie, you keep going on your travels.
BIANCA's Dad: Hey! Who do you think<LINE>you are? This is a family matter!
My name is ELESA.<LINE>I'm this town's GYM LEADER.<LINE>I also happen to be a model.
You know, there are many people<LINE>in this world.<LINE>There are people whose way of thinking<LINE>may be completely different from yours.<LINE><LINE>Sometimes, this means you may get hurt.
BIANCA's Dad: Of course!<LINE>That's exactly right!<LINE>It's because I'm worried about that…
ELESA: But it's important to keep trying,<LINE>to learn about the differences between<LINE><LINE>yourself and others…<LINE>To learn that being different is OK.<LINE>And you shouldn't worry.<LINE>Trainers always have POKéMON<LINE>at their side.<LINE>POKéMON are wonderful. It's not only how<LINE>cute they can be, but also how much you<LINE><LINE>can depend on them…
BIANCA: Please!<LINE>I know there's gonna be painful stuff<LINE>like you're worrying about!<LINE><LINE>I know! Really, I get it!<LINE>But, like, listen…<LINE>There'll be tons of nice people, too.<LINE>Know what else? Since I've been<LINE>traveling with POKéMON, I've already<LINE><LINE>gotten tougher, I can totally tell.<LINE>So…please?
BIANCA's Dad: Hmm…<LINE>I guess.<LINE>If wanting to continue your journey<LINE>is selfishness on your part,<LINE><LINE>wanting to stop you is<LINE><LINE>selfishness on mine.<LINE>I'm surprised to find I'm the one<LINE>being childish--at my age!
This GYM LEADER's comments helped me<LINE>wake up.<LINE>BIANCA, I'm sure it's better that you<LINE>take the path you want to take now.<LINE>I hope that your journey will be fun.<LINE>Bon voyage!
<PLAYER>, please…<LINE>Take care of my little girl, OK?
BIANCA: Papa, I'll come home after<LINE>I find out what I really want to do!
ELESA: I'm sure he traveled<LINE>as a Trainer himself, in the past…<LINE><LINE>Being a parent must be hard.
Did I meddle unnecessarily?<LINE>You looked troubled, so<LINE>I decided to chime in.
By the way, if you're Trainers, please<LINE>stop by the POKéMON GYM.<LINE>I'll teach you a little something about<LINE>how tough a journey can get.
I'm sorry, <PLAYER>.<LINE>I'll be waiting on ROUTE 5.
BIANCA: She's so cool! Hah!<LINE>I want to be a totally cool woman<LINE><LINE>like ELESA!<LINE>Mm. I wonder how I'll get there.<LINE>Well, before that, I guess I need to<LINE>discover what I really want to do!<LINE><LINE>See you later, <PLAYER>!
We athletes and our POKéMON<LINE>show excellent teamwork!<LINE>You can see it at Big Stadium and<LINE>Small Court, so please stop by!
As it happens, NIMBASA CITY is a major<LINE>destination for POKéMON battles.<LINE>There are POKéMON Trainers in<LINE>lots of these buildings.
Leisurely trips by train…<LINE>Riding from Gear Station to<LINE>ANVILLE TOWN feels a bit like a dream.
Coming to flashy NIMBASA CITY makes<LINE>me feel light and happy, as if I were<LINE><LINE>holding an Air Balloon.
There are performers<LINE>crowding around ROUTE 5.<LINE>Seeing all the fun the POKéMON and<LINE>Trainers are having fills me with energy!
I was a good girl, so I got to<LINE>go to the amusement park!
Ferris wheel! Ferris wheel!<LINE>I love Ferris wheels!
NIMBASA's POKéMON GYM is<LINE>in the amusement park!<LINE>No doubt it has a surprising gimmick!
I won!<LINE>Then I lost…
