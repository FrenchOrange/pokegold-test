Oh! You've become strong! I can tell.<LINE>Do you want to have a battle with me?
Well, let's begin!
You think about battles very thoroughly.<LINE>I lost, but I learned a lot from you.<LINE>Besides, it was fun!<LINE>Come back again tomorrow.
No?<LINE>I've been raising POKéMON, thinking about<LINE>their Abilities and just the right<LINE><LINE>combination of held items.<LINE>What a pity…<LINE>
I'm Snorlax.<LINE>No, no. I'm the Planner!<LINE>I don't mean to butt in, but the<LINE>Leftovers item is important, isn't it?
I am the Sound Designer!<LINE>I put in a lot of wonderful mechanisms<LINE>to change the game's music!<LINE>How many of them have you noticed?
I can tell you take the sound seriously,<LINE>so here's a treat for you!<LINE>What do you think about this<LINE>dramatic sound?
Were you surprised?<LINE>Well, for a strong Trainer like you,<LINE>winning against Team Rocket<LINE><LINE>would be a piece of cake!
