Who are you?<LINE>How impudent you are to disturb my sleep.<LINE>Hmf…<LINE>You appear to possess a combination of<LINE>strength and kindness. Very well.<LINE>Make your best effort not to bore me<LINE>with a yawn-inducing battle. Clear?
You haven't faced all of the members<LINE>of the Elite Four yet, have you?<LINE>Don't concern yourself about me.<LINE>Go on ahead.
In the past, when I battled, the force<LINE>of my emotions shook me greatly.<LINE>When my power awoke, I came close to<LINE>destroying everything around me.<LINE>That weak person no longer exists…<LINE>Still, sometimes, my determination fails.<LINE>Always, I aspire to wrap up a victory<LINE>with elegance and grace.<LINE>I invite you to be my opponent<LINE>again in the future, if you wish.
Somehow, you managed to defeat the<LINE>entire Elite Four of the POKéMON LEAGUE.<LINE>Check the statue in the center of the<LINE>plaza for the way to the Champion's room.
Who's there?<LINE>Who is so uncouth as to disturb my sleep?<LINE>Hmf… It's you again.<LINE>Still, you possess that combination of<LINE>kindness and strength. Yet you seem<LINE><LINE>stronger than before…<LINE>Do be sure not to bore me with a<LINE>snooze-inducing battle, is that clear?
Alas! Even with the knowledge and skill<LINE>passed down in my family of trainers,<LINE><LINE>I still can't win.<LINE>The reason I came here in the first place<LINE>was to encounter trainers like you…
In the past, my untrained heart made my<LINE>power run wild.<LINE><LINE>I was forbidden to battle.<LINE>All I craved then was to experience the<LINE>pure excitement of battling like this.<LINE>Hee hee…<LINE>Although I'm embarrassed, I can't help<LINE><LINE>smiling right now.
