Those robbers… What in the world is<LINE>TEAM PLASMA?
What do they plan to accomplish by<LINE>stealing the Dragon Skull?

Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton,<LINE>I'm…fascinated.
Welcome! I'm HAWES, the<LINE>assistant director.<LINE>Since you were kind enough to visit,<LINE>I'll give you a tour of the museum.
This skeleton is of a Dragon-type<LINE>POKéMON.<LINE>There's a theory that it had an accident<LINE>while it was flying around the world, and<LINE><LINE>so it became a fossil.
This rock is amazing! It's a meteorite!<LINE>It contains some kind of energy<LINE>from space.
Oh, this? It's an ordinary old stone.<LINE>It was found near the desert, but other<LINE>than the fact that it's old, it doesn't<LINE><LINE>seem to have any value…<LINE>We only display it because it's rather<LINE>pretty to look at.
The POKéMON GYM is just beyond here.

LENORA: Now, you wait!<LINE>Enough fooling around!
TEAM PLASMA: So you've come, GYM LEADER.<LINE>We, TEAM PLASMA, claim this museum's<LINE>Dragon Skull in the name of<LINE><LINE>POKéMON liberation!
TEAM PLASMA: To show you we're serious,<LINE>we'll steal it right before your eyes!
TEAM PLASMA: Well, then, here's<LINE>our smoke screen!
Plasmaaaa!
LENORA: What's going on?
HAWES: Oh! Oh! We have to go after them!
HAWES: LENORA loves that skull…
BIANCA: I won't forgive those thieves!
CHEREN: So I can't battle the GYM LEADER<LINE>because of TEAM PLASMA, huh…<LINE>What a bother.
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious…<LINE>From the outside, you can't see their<LINE>functional, efficient design.<LINE>It's almost as if it is an embodiment of<LINE>their former essence… So fascinating!
My oh my oh my!
Those thugs sure were bold…<LINE>It's almost as if they believe they are<LINE>doing the right thing.
Perhaps there is a POKéMON that came<LINE>from space along with this meteorite.
What in the world could TEAM PLASMA<LINE>be thinking?!
Part of the skeleton was stolen by<LINE>TEAM PLASMA and is missing!
