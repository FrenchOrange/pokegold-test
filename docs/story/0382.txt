I come shop at the Shopping Mall a lot<LINE>because I want all the TMs!
On the first floor, they sell medicines.<LINE>On the second floor, they sell TMs<LINE>and different kinds of Mail.<LINE>On the third floor, they sell items for<LINE>raising stats and battle items.<LINE>I really admire Mr. Clyde, the<LINE>POKéMON GYM guide, so I'm practicing<LINE><LINE>being a guide, too!
There are even some people in the mall<LINE>who will challenge you to battles.
The thing I buy most often is the item<LINE>that raises a POKéMON's HP, called HP Up.<LINE>There are also a lot of other items that<LINE>catch my eye.









Good trainers never use only<LINE>brute force.<LINE>They think about many different<LINE>strategies, such as which POKéMON and<LINE><LINE>moves to use in battle, or the best time<LINE><LINE>to use an item.
Playing hide-and-seek would be fun!
