If you are a Trainer, will you show me<LINE>how you are raising your POKéMON<LINE><LINE>with loving care?
Oh, I understand!<LINE>You are a shy Trainer!
Oh!<LINE>Which POKéMON will you show me?

…Hmmm.<LINE>It's hard to tell…
Well…it's a bit hard to tell how much<LINE>that EGG has grown.
Oh! This <PLAYER> was level \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0001<LINE>when you met, but now it's level \xf000Ȃ\x0001\x0002!
You've raised it very well.<LINE>It's received a lot of love from you.
You've raised it quite well.<LINE>I feel your love for this POKéMON.
You've raised it well.<LINE>You must be affectionate.
I see! Although it's just a smidgen,<LINE>I can feel your love for your POKéMON.
That is a token of gratitude for showing<LINE>me your great love for your POKéMON!
Well, you showed me good stuff!<LINE>Please keep raising your POKéMON<LINE>with loving care!
What? It has not grown at all.<LINE>Still, if you travel with your POKéMON<LINE>from now on, I am sure it will grow!
Welcome to the POKéMON Fan Club.<LINE>Shall I check how friendly your POKéMON<LINE>is toward you?

I can't tell whether or not you and<LINE>the EGG are close friends.
Oh, my. Your <PLAYER>…
It is super friendly to you!<LINE>I'm a bit jealous!
It is quite friendly to you!<LINE>You must be a kind person!
It is friendly to you.<LINE>It must be happy with you.
It is a little friendly to you…<LINE>That's what I'm getting.
The relationship is neither good<LINE>nor bad… It looks neutral.
Hmmm…<LINE>It may not like you very much.
By any chance, you…<LINE>Are you a very strict person?<LINE>I feel that it really doesn't like you…
Oh, you are so shy! Come on,<LINE>don't hide your POKéMON from me.
Muuun!
Glibalugga!
