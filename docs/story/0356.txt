CHEREN: <PLAYER>!<LINE>This bothersome bunch doesn't<LINE>really listen to reason.
TEAM PLASMA: That child cannot use<LINE>a POKéMON to its full potential.<LINE>Doesn't that make the POKéMON sad?<LINE>It's the same thing for all your POKéMON,<LINE>so hand them over to us now!<LINE>Better yet…<LINE>We'll just take them!
TEAM PLASMA: Wha…? How could we lose<LINE>when we have right on our side?!
CHEREN: Not bad, <PLAYER>.<LINE>OK, go return the POKéMON to that girl.
You don't need to return it!
TEAM PLASMA: How troublesome.<LINE>Not only do you fail to understand, but<LINE>you actually got in our way, to boot.
TEAM PLASMA: There's two of you<LINE>and two of us.<LINE>We'll show you our combined power<LINE>and teach you that we are right!
CHEREN: So, there were more of them…<LINE>Still, why are POKéMON robbers<LINE>acting so self-righteous?
<PLAYER>!<LINE>We've been friends our whole lives.<LINE>We've got each other's back when it<LINE><LINE>counts. Let's show them how it's done!
TEAM PLASMA: In order to liberate<LINE>POKéMON from foolish people,<LINE><LINE>we will take their POKéMON!
CHEREN: Whatever…<LINE>What a waste of time.<LINE>Come on, what reason could possibly<LINE>justify stealing POKéMON from people?
TEAM PLASMA: POKéMON trainers<LINE>like you are making POKéMON suffer…
CHEREN: What do you mean, trainers are<LINE>making POKéMON suffer?<LINE><LINE>I don't get that at all!
TEAM PLASMA: We'll give you back<LINE>the POKéMON…<LINE>But be aware of how this POKéMON suffers<LINE>from being used by people.
TEAM PLASMA: Someday, open your eyes<LINE>to your own complicity.
CHEREN: trainers bring out<LINE>their POKéMON's strength.<LINE>POKéMON believe in their<LINE>trainers and respond to that.<LINE>I don't understand what about<LINE>that makes POKéMON suffer!
OK, <PLAYER>,<LINE>I'll return the POKéMON.
