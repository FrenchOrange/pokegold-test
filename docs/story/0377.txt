BIANCA: <PLAYER>!
As I've been traveling lately,<LINE>I've been thinking about things.<LINE>Things like what I can do with my life,<LINE>and what I want to do, but…<LINE>I'm thinking how cool it would be<LINE>to be a model like ELESA.<LINE>And then, how cool it would be to do<LINE>research on POKéMON like<LINE><LINE>PROF.JUNIPER…<LINE>If that's what I want to do, I'm gonna<LINE>have to know a lot about POKéMON.<LINE><LINE>Sooooo…would you please battle me?
BIANCA: Yep!<LINE><PLAYER>, you're amazing!<LINE>I'm really, really, really impressed, and<LINE>that makes me want to give this to you!
BIANCA: In CASTELIA CITY, my precious<LINE>POKéMON was stolen by TEAM PLASMA.<LINE>So I really, really understand!<LINE>If TEAM PLASMA forces everyone to<LINE>liberate their POKéMON,<LINE><LINE>there will be nothing but sad people!<LINE><PLAYER>!<LINE>Stop TEAM PLASMA!<LINE>Don't allow POKéMON to be stolen<LINE>from trainers who love them!<LINE>I think that's the truth--or ideal--that<LINE>you've been pursuing, <PLAYER>…
BIANCA: Oh dear, here I've come all this<LINE>way, and I'm afraid I'm bothering you<LINE><LINE>when you're going through so much.<LINE>All I wanted was to help you relax,<LINE><PLAYER>.<LINE>Knowing you, you'll be fine!<LINE>Definitely! You'll totally be fine!<LINE>I guarantee it!<LINE>Anyway, you know what I mean…<LINE>Yeah… So, bye-bye!
