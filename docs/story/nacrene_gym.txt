Tee hee! What a pity!<LINE>This book about TEPIG says:<LINE>'It gives off flame from its nostrils.<LINE>When it's not well, it can give off<LINE><LINE>only smoke.'<LINE>That's slightly different from 'it gives<LINE>off smoke from its head while it runs.'<LINE>…The answer to this memo may not be<LINE>a living thing. Tee hee!
Wow! Great! That's correct!<LINE>The book that I am reading says:<LINE>'It gives off flame from its nostrils.<LINE>When it's not well, it can give off<LINE><LINE>only smoke.'<LINE>It's slightly different from 'it gives off<LINE>smoke from its head while it runs.'<LINE>…The answer to this memo may not be<LINE>a living thing.
