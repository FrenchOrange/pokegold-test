Skreeree…
This POKéMON has become attached to me.<LINE>But as far as I'm concerned, a POKéMON<LINE>is just a simple tool.<LINE>I don't understand…
Will you go to the POKéMON LEAGUE?
Go!
I see.
I don't need an item to catch<LINE>POKéMON anymore…
POKé BALLS…<LINE>From my point of view, they are items<LINE>that keep POKéMON confined.<LINE>But for trainers like you, they are a way<LINE>to bond with POKéMON…<LINE>If you run out of POKé BALLS,<LINE>come see me. I will give one to you.
You need a POKé BALL?<LINE>OK. Take this.
