Welcome!<LINE>Welcome to my party!<LINE>Please enjoy conversations<LINE>with everyone!
Ich habe mir nun ein Auto zugelegt!<LINE>Damit ist die nächste Stadt auch<LINE>ganz ohne Orden zum Greifen nah!<LINE>Es sei denn, ich rassele durch<LINE>meine Führerscheinprüfung…
Hello. Have you tried a CASTELIAcone yet?<LINE>I managed to buy one on Tuesday, but<LINE>it's very difficult to get!
Hey, Trainer!<LINE>Check out my moves!<LINE>Have you gone to the next city yet?<LINE>I learned this move at the<LINE><LINE>musical over there.<LINE><LINE>Pretty cool, isn't it?
Ohhhh! Your POKéMON are so charming!<LINE>I want cute POKéMON, too, so I can<LINE>use this!
This move makes your POKéMON<LINE>unbearably charming!<LINE>All POKéMON of the opposite gender<LINE>will fall in love!
Did you see the dress that the<LINE>supermodel, ELESA, was wearing?
Whatever ELESA wears is beautiful.<LINE>A stunning ensemble!
My boyfriend isn't good at getting out of<LINE>bed in the morning…<LINE>In fact, he's so slow getting out of bed<LINE>that I asked his POKéMON to use<LINE><LINE>Wake-Up Slap on him!
Ciao!<LINE>Ti stai divertendo?<LINE>Non sentirti in imbarazzo.<LINE>Parla pure con chi vuoi.
It's hard to get up the morning after<LINE>a fun day like today.
I've asked my POKéMON to use Sing<LINE>instead of setting an alarm clock.<LINE>But I cannot get up at all.<LINE>I don't know why.
¡Es la primera vez que vengo aquí!<LINE>¡Pero este precioso paisaje hace<LINE>que me sienta como en casa!<LINE>¡La próxima vez traeré a mis amigos!
