CHEREN: <PLAYER>, stop!<LINE>You've got a Bolt BADGE…<LINE>I've got a Bolt BADGE…<LINE>Let's test who's stronger--you or me!<LINE>This time, I'm going to win!
CHEREN: Why?<LINE>Why can't I beat you?
ELESA: Oh, you two are friends…<LINE>That's nice, how you're helping each<LINE>other get better by competing.
OK, let's go.
???: Oh!<LINE>Why, if it isn't ELESA!
???: Aren't festivals grand?<LINE>Life should be enjoyed!
CHEREN: Who is this man?
ELESA: This is ALDER,<LINE>the UNOVA region's Champion.
CHEREN: Champion?!<LINE>Why would the Champion be<LINE>goofing off in a place like this?
ALDER: I heard that remark.<LINE>You're quite a judgmental young person,<LINE><LINE>are you not?<LINE>My name is ALDER. I'm the UNOVA<LINE>POKéMON LEAGUE's Champion.<LINE>Pleased to make your acquaintance.<LINE>For your information, I'm not<LINE>goofing off. I'm on a voyage.<LINE><LINE>I know every corner of UNOVA.
CHEREN: Um. I'm CHEREN, from<LINE>NUVEMA TOWN.<LINE>My goal as a trainer is to<LINE>become the Champion.
ALDER: Hm. Traveling with a goal in mind<LINE>is a commendable thing.<LINE>And what do you plan to do<LINE>after becoming the Champion?
CHEREN: What else is there other than<LINE>striving to become stronger?<LINE>The strongest trainer--<LINE>that's the Champion.
ALDER: Hmm. Becoming stronger…<LINE>Becoming stronger, you say…<LINE><LINE>Is that alone enough of a goal? Hmmm.<LINE>It's not that I'm trying to say your way<LINE>of thinking is wrong…
In my travels, I've helped many people<LINE>learn to love POKéMON. I think that's<LINE><LINE>important, too.<LINE>If you play with those children,<LINE>you might gain more of an understanding.<LINE>Will you two have a POKéMON battle<LINE>with those two?
Hey, you two. Come<LINE>here for a moment.
CHEREN: …Understood.<LINE>But, before that…
CHEREN fully healed <LINE><PLAYER>'s POKéMON!
CHEREN: OK, let's battle.
ALDER: Nicely done! You didn't win, but<LINE>that was a good battle. Your POKéMON<LINE><LINE>looked like they were having fun.
Young man, if there are people<LINE>like you who pursue strength,<LINE><LINE>there are also people who are<LINE><LINE>happy just being with POKéMON.<LINE>There are many different people<LINE>and many different answers.<LINE>When it comes to what a Champion<LINE>should be, you and I may hold differing<LINE><LINE>views, but so be it! Give it some thought.
ALDER: It's tremendous that people and<LINE>POKéMON, each so different, can<LINE><LINE>acknowledge each other and be together!
ALDER is so strong!<LINE>And he's nice to POKéMON!
I was scared of POKéMON, but ALDER<LINE>taught me that they're nice and friendly.
ELESA: Let's roll.<LINE>The DRIFTVEIL DRAWBRIDGE is just ahead.
CHEREN: The Champion is the strongest<LINE>of the strong! That's all there is to it.
CHEREN: This way.
ELESA: Now to contact him…
It's me, ELESA.<LINE>Please lower the drawbridge.<LINE>I have a couple of trainers here<LINE>who want to challenge you.<LINE>OK…<LINE>Thanks.
Now, watch this!
ELESA: I have a TV gig, so I've got to go.<LINE>The GYM LEADER of the next town<LINE>may take some getting used to…<LINE><LINE>Do your best, both of you.
CHEREN: What I am is a trainer.<LINE>I prove I'm right by getting stronger<LINE>and winning in battle--<LINE><LINE>even against the Champion.
Excuse me!<LINE>Please stop right there!
The drawbridge is raised right now<LINE>so ships can pass. You can't cross.<LINE>If you make a request to DRIFTVEIL's GYM<LINE>LEADER, CLAY, he could… Well, I'm not<LINE><LINE>sure how you'd reach him over there…<LINE>If you talk to NIMBASA CITY's GYM LEADER,<LINE>ELESA, she might be able to do something.

A bridge would be meaningless<LINE>if no one ever crossed it.<LINE>Bridges connect the world…<LINE>That's as solid as a symbol can get.
Hum fiercely! My battle song!<LINE>Battle fiercely! My POKéMON!
In battling you, I came to understand…<LINE>You're the best!<LINE>Here! This is for you!


If you want your POKéMON to<LINE>hold this Electric Guitar,<LINE><LINE>go to the Musical Theater!<LINE><LINE>Cooler than cool!
CHEREN: Strength and strength alone<LINE>is what matters in this world.<LINE>So I believed, until I met ALDER here.
But, winning in POKéMON battles<LINE>isn't all there is to life.<LINE>Once I learned that lesson, my eyes<LINE>were opened to many different things.
We all have our own brand of strength,<LINE>people and POKéMON both.<LINE>The strength to make our dreams<LINE>a reality, the strength to protect<LINE><LINE>what we hold most dear…
Why do I think this way now?<LINE>It's thanks to you, <PLAYER>…<LINE>And BIANCA…<LINE>And ALDER…<LINE>If only N could see this, too, someday.
I'm going to take a long, hard look<LINE>at myself on VICTORY ROAD.<LINE>I'm going to think about what I can do<LINE>and who I can become…<LINE>Visit me sometime, if you want.<LINE>We'll have a battle like old times.
The POKéMON and the performers<LINE>all have amazing moves!
I think being able to make people<LINE>smile is a super-awesome talent!<LINE>That's why POKéMON are so awesome!<LINE>Because they can make you smile!
The street performers are my favorites.<LINE>They're so charming!
